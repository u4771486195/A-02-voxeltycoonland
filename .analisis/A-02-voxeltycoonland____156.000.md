![Merry Christmas 🎄](/assets/posts/2018.gif)

This is the second Christmas for Voxel Tycoon! Thank you for your support, everybody!

First off, some statistics: there’s more than **15,000** lines of code in the project, and more than **3,000** commits made to the repository. And that's just a small part of what's planned 😊

Second, as you may know, at the beginning of the year we set a rough deadline: release the game by the end of 2017. Also, Voxel Tycoon became our full-time job in August.

Now, game development is a tricky thing. It’s full of many, many tasks - it's hard to properly estimate how many, and how large or small they are. You can’t imagine how much we want to let you play the game, and see the results of all the work we've done over these two years.

However, our main priority is quality. The very first release may only have basic content, but it still should be comfortable and fun to play. To match these standards there are a few important things that still need to be finished in the coming months.

We hope you don't mind. Believe us, we are doing everything we can to deliver Voxel Tycoon to you as fast as possible.

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! See you in 2018 🎄

```yaml
- version: '0.89'
  date: 2025-04-06 01:30:00 +0300
  text: Check the <a href="/devlog/wear-and-tear-update">blog post</a> for details.
  groups:
    gameplay:
    - Added a <b>vehicle wear and reliability system</b> – vehicles now require maintenance over time.
    - Vehicle performance decreases as wear increases.
    - You can now configure service intervals to control maintenance frequency.
    - Depot tasks can now be added directly to vehicle schedules.
    - When setting up vehicle replacement, you can now set the wear level a vehicle should reach before being replaced. When this setting is enabled, you can also enable self-replacement, effectively allowing vehicles to automatically replace themselves when worn out.
    - New trucks have been added to each generation, and older trucks have been reworked (thanks <b>@scailman</b>!).
    - All vehicles have been rebalanced to offer variety in their strengths and weaknesses.
    improvements:
    - Vehicles and buildings are now clearly split into 'current' and 'obsolete' categories as the player progresses through research.
    - Higher-tier vehicles are no longer locked behind Depot II. Instead, Tier II depots now offer lower maintenance costs.
    - Removed confusing schedule options that didn’t make sense when selecting waypoints.
    - Improved game startup time.
    - When placing signals, the regular signal is now selected by default instead of the pre-signal.
    - Added search functionality to the Settings window (just start typing).
    - Improved Builder Tool window performance when playing with many mods.
    - Added privacy controls for analytics data collection.
    fixes:
    - Fixed an issue where the UI could become completely locked in some scenarios.
    - Fixed heap item storage renderer.
    - Fixed a bug where a pink tint could remain after using the vehicle picker tool (a.k.a. Worm Train issue).
    - Fixed an issue where trains couldn't find their way after exiting a depot in some cases.
    - Fixed an issue where trains could explode when turning around while partially inside a depot.
    modding:
    - You can now repaint assets directly in the game world using the new <b>Paint Assets</b> tool. To enable it, open <b>Settings</b> while holding <kbd>Shift</kbd>, go to the <b>Misc</b> tab, and toggle <b>Asset Paint Tool</b> (you can type “Asset” to find it). Then reload your save file – the tool will appear in the <b>Toolbar</b> under the <b>Other</b> category. When enabled, the setting introduces a performance overhead, so be sure to disable it once you're done using the tool.
    - Simplified stack and heap storage definitions with a new <code>Bounds</code> property, along with automatic <code>Resolution</code> and <code>Keyframes</code> calculation (see standard car assets for examples).
    - Added a <code>Generation</code> property for building, car, and train assets.
    - Added a <code>Reliability</code> property for car and train assets.
    - Added a new <code>Experimental</code> vehicle engine type.
    - Auto price calculation now takes max speed and reliability into account.
    - Unity updated to 6000.0.43.

- version: '0.88.10'

    - Sorting by earnings and costs in the Fleet window is now dynamic and properly reorders rows as values change.

    - Settings window now resizes with resolution and UI scale changes.
    - If Notifications log is open, no other windows will be closed on <kbd>Esc</kbd>.
    fixes:

    - Fixed an issue where, when you followed a vehicle and unfollowed it by toggling in the vehicle UI, using WASD keys, or edge scrolling, the camera jumped back to where following started.
    - Fixed Vehicle replacement window often spawning with the Add replacement button hidden below the toolbar.

---

This step-by-step guide is intended for mod creators who want to feature their creations on the in-game Mod Gallery. Like this:

{% include img.html src="/assets/sdk/publish_your_mod/20180514-192535.png" %}

> **Note**: Current implementation is temporary. After the release of the game on Steam, we will incorporate Steam Workshop support, so the publishing process may change.

## Obtain credentials

If you want to become a publisher, you should obtain credentials so our servers can identify you as an Author. We do not have a user interface for registration at the moment, so please contact **@devs** on our [Discord server](//discord.gg/64KPWd5).

> **Note**: Please ensure that you have read and agreed with our [EULA](/eula) before publishing mods.

You will receive an `identity.json` file - this is your key to publishing access. Put the file into the root of your `Content/` folder. Next time the game runs, it will know that you are an Author.

> **Important:** Do not share identity file with anyone. If you do, any person that has it can publish, update or remove your mods in the Gallery.

## Prepare mod for publishing

Actually, at this point your mod already can be published. But you probably want to add some final touches to it first.

### Add preview image

Take a screenshot of your mod in action, and save it as `preview.png`. Drop the image into your mod's root folder. To be properly scaled in the Gallery, its dimensions should be `184х110` pixels.

### Set custom title and description

Create a new `.txt` file, rename it to `pack.json`, and place it in your mod's root folder. Its contents should be set up as follows:

```json
{
    "Title" : "My awesome mod",
    "Description" : "This mod contains some cool stuff!"
 }
```

## Publish, update and unpublish

Just click on your mod in the **Installed** tab, and choose the appropriate action.

{% include img.html src="/assets/sdk/publish_your_mod/20180514-193710.png" %}

> You can publish only mods that are not tracked as **installed**, i.e. was not downloaded from the gallery but manually placed to `Content/` by you.

If you are updating a mod that is already published, users that have it installed will see that an update is available for it.

## Limits

To prevent our servers from being completely filled with content, we're temporarily restricting how many packs users can publish. Your limit can be seen at  [https://voxeltycoon-mods.herokuapp.com/limits?uid=`your_secret_key`](https://voxeltycoon-mods.herokuapp.com/limits?uid=your_secret_key), where "your_secret_key" is the one stored in your specific `identity.json` file.

## Where's SDK 2.0?

All required tools to create mods are now [bundled with the game](/buy).

## Documentation

All modding docs are currently hosted [here](https://github.com/voxeltycoon/docs/wiki) (look at the menu on the right).

The best starting point is this tutorial: [Creating your first content mod](https://github.com/voxeltycoon/docs/wiki/Creating-your-first-content-mod)

## Design guidelines

Do not try to exactly mimic real life representation, but rather try to get fancy nice-looking feel that fits the game overall style.

You can notice that our models are:

* Much shorter than their prototypes
* Can have different count of axles
* Not overdetailed but still recognizable
* Vivid and toy-ish looking
* The biggest buildings have maximum size of `5x5x10`

{% include img.html src="/assets/sdk/guidelines/20180417-141213-1.png"
src2="/assets/sdk/guidelines/20180417-141213.png" %}

{% include img.html src="/assets/sdk/guidelines/Layer3.png"
src2="/assets/sdk/guidelines/Layer2.png" %}

{% include img.html src="/assets/sdk/guidelines/dbv200.png"
src2="/assets/sdk/guidelines/dbv200-1.png" %}

Use vivid colors instead of faded ones, but not too much:

{% include img.html src="/assets/sdk/guidelines/3a-1.png" src2="/assets/sdk/guidelines/3a.png" src3="/assets/sdk/guidelines/3b.png" %}

Darker windows look better. Consider using predefined colors:

{% include img.html src="/assets/sdk/guidelines/2a.png"
src2="/assets/sdk/guidelines/2b.png" %}

Consider some parts of the model to use smooth shading:

{% include img.html src="/assets/sdk/guidelines/2.png"
src2="/assets/sdk/guidelines/1.png" %}

Another example:

{% include img.html src="/assets/sdk/guidelines/1a.png"
src2="/assets/sdk/guidelines/1b.png" %}

All of that is just a recommendation and not hard rules. Be creative!

## What is it?

It's a tool for you to preview and customize any 3rd-party content (trains, buildings or even trees) in the actual game's environment.

{% include img.html src="/assets/sdk/preview.gif" %}

## Downloads

### Download for [Windows](https://github.com/andrewpey/vtland/releases/download/test/VoxelTycoonSDK.zip)
### Download for [macOS](https://github.com/andrewpey/vtland/releases/download/test/VoxelTycoonSDK_Mac.zip)

## Step-by-step tutorial

> You can always get help on our [#modding](https://discord.gg/dXBmWRr) channel at Discord.

First, create a model in your favorite modeling software. We use Blender ❤

For the reference you can use models that came with the download.

{% include img.html src="/assets/sdk/1.png" %}

 After you're done with the modeling, select a model to ensure nothing unwanted will be exported, and hit Export as `OBJ`:

{% include img.html src="/assets/sdk/2.png" %}

Ensure that the `Selection only` and `Include UVs` options are checked:

{% include img.html src="/assets/sdk/2-1.png" %}

Set the filename — in this example we use `MyModel.obj` — and save file to `VoxelTycoonSDK/Trains` (if you are creating something related to trains) or `VoxelTycoonSDK/Buildings` (for enything else, like buildings or trees):

{% include img.html src="/assets/sdk/3.png" %}

Now go to the VoxelTycoonSDK tool and choose `Buildings` or `Trains` from the second dropdown (based on where you've placed your model in the previous step). Then choose your model from the last dropdown:

{% include img.html src="/assets/sdk/4.png" %}

The SDK will generate a palette texture called `MyModel.png` in the same folder where your `OBJ` file is stored. This palette will be used to to set the coloring for your model.

{% include img.html src="/assets/sdk/4-1.png" %}

Go back into the modeling software and open UV editing mode:

{% include img.html src="/assets/sdk/5.png" %}

Load the generated palette texture `MyModel.png` from the directory where you've placed your model (`VoxelTycoonSDK/Buildings` or `VoxelTycoondSDK/Trains`):

{% include img.html src="/assets/sdk/6.png" %}

{% include img.html src="/assets/sdk/7.png" %}

{% include img.html src="/assets/sdk/8.png" %}

Unwrap the model using the colors from the palette. The colors in the palette are not important yet, we just need to map vertices' UVs to the separate colors. You will set up the actual colors in the VoxelTycoonSDK tool later.

{% include img.html src="/assets/sdk/9.png" %}

After unwrapping has finished, export the model as an `OBJ` again, rewriting your previous `OBJ`.

Go back to the VoxelTycoonSDK tool again. Click through different parts of the model and choose the colors in the color picker on the right bottom corner.

{% include img.html src="/assets/sdk/10.png" %}

> **Pro Tip** You can pick colors from other parts of the  model by holding `ALT`.

You're done! Feel free to share your work [with us](/contacts).

Рисуем модель в любимом 3D-редакторе. Для нас это Blender ❤

Ориентироваться можно на модели, которые идут в комплекте с утилитой.

{% include img.html src="/assets/sdk/1.png" %}

 После того, как модель готова, выделяем ее, чтобы не экспортировать ничего лишнего. Открываем окно экспорта в формате `OBJ`:

{% include img.html src="/assets/sdk/2.png" %}

Проверяем, что стоят галочки `Selection only`, `Include UVs` и `Triangulate Faces`:

{% include img.html src="/assets/sdk/2-1.png" %}

Называем файл, например, `MyModel.obj` и сохраняем его в папку `VoxelTycoonSDK/Trains` (если это локомотив или вагон) или `VoxelTycoonSDK/Buldings` (для всего остального — зданий, деревьев и тд):

{% include img.html src="/assets/sdk/3.png" %}

Открываем утилиту, выбираем тип модели в соответствии с именем папки, в которую мы положили нашу модель (`Buildings` или `Trains`) и выбираем нашу модель из списка:

{% include img.html src="/assets/sdk/4.png" %}

В этот момент рядом с нашим файлом `MyModel.obj` появится файл с палитрой `MyModel.png`, который мы будем использовать для подгтовки модели к раскраске:

{% include img.html src="/assets/sdk/4-1.png" %}

Возвращаемся в 3D-редактор и переходим в режим редактирования UV:

{% include img.html src="/assets/sdk/5.png" %}

Открываем файл с палитрой `MyModel.png`, который лежит в папке `VoxelTycoonSDK/Buildings` или `VoxelTycoondSDK/Trains` рядом с нашим `MyModel.obj`:

{% include img.html src="/assets/sdk/6.png" %}


{% include img.html src="/assets/sdk/7.png" %}

{% include img.html src="/assets/sdk/8.png" %}

Делаем развертку, используя цвета из палитры. Сейчас нам надо просто раскидать UV вершин по цветам в палитре, а сами цвета мы потом подберем в утилите.

{% include img.html src="/assets/sdk/9.png" %}

После того, как развертка готова, еще раз экспортируем модель в `OBJ` и перезаписываем файл `MyModel.obj`.

Возвращаемся в утилиту. Кликаем по очереди на участки модели, которым мы назначили разные цвета, и выбираем для них нужный цвет в правом нижнем углу:

{% include img.html src="/assets/sdk/10.png" %}

> **Совет** Вы можете копировать цвета из других частей модели, удерживая `ALT`.

Готово! Выкладывайте скриншоты в [паблике](http://vk.com/voxeltycoon) и делитесь тем, что получилось :D

If you've been following the development of VT for some time, you may notice that our estimated release date has changed several times. It was never an exact date, but regardless, we didn't meet them. From that, a reasonable question arises - why is that? And what's taking so long?

## The bright side of Indie

We are an independent developer. This means we are free to work on the game in the way we feel will be better for Voxel Tycoon and our future players. This also means we have no strict deadlines, and thus can continue polishing things without sacrificing quality. This exact method resulted in all the stuff we've done already and you found interesting when joining our ever-growing community.

When we see something not quite fit our level of quality, we may return to that feature and work more on it until we're satisfied with it. This is the main reason why our estimated deadlines are not met.

With all of that aside, we do have a strong motivation to release Voxel Tycoon alpha as soon as possible. The day when you can finally play the game, and when we find out what we did right and wrong, is the most important day for us.

In the end, we are just balancing these aspects — quality, and release.

## A few words about the team

{% include img.html src="https://images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/8nvYtWvaY_vvroI_597pbMzPETtEGo3JA5qFkQiGSlY/https/pp.userapi.com/c840323/v840323836/80276/VTqhfby5Xj4.jpg?width=1192&height=671" %}


As some of you may know, there are just two guys working on the game, full time, 7 days per week without holidays. At the beginning, we worked remotely, but in April we gathered our equipment in one room where we set up an improvised office.

## What's left to do?

The most important things that aren't done yet are as follows:

### Under active development

* Final tools
* Modular stations / Hubs
* Electricity
* Pipes / Liquids
* Finalized UI

### Still in concept stage

* Geological surveying
* Tech Tree / Research and Development

> Also, we should note that to make a release come sooner, we may be forced to remove some features that were planned for the first alpha and continue working on them outside. If that happens, we'll give another update on the situation.

## What's already done?

Everything that needed to make the game basically playable except listed above. Of course, there's a lot of things will be tuned here and there, but nothing that major that can move release for months.

## What's in development right now?

{% include img.html src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/394070514395774977/451064735572426753/unknown.png?width=1152&height=648" %}

**Maxim** is improving the user experience of laying out roads, rails, and conveyors as we feel previous implementations were too hard to use without outbursts of rage.

**Andrew** is working on the final implementation of the modular stations (or **hubs**) concept, which defines how stations, cities, storage facilities, and factories interact with each other.

If you haven't yet, we invite you to join our [Discord community](http://discord.gg/64KPWd5) where you can talk to us, or just see what we're up to.

## Why are there so few gameplay videos out at the moment?

There are two reasons for this. First, as the game is in a very active state of development, it gets broken over and over again as we change features. And second, even more important — as you read before, many parts of the game go through many iterations. Anything we show in a video could (and probably would) change before the game makes it to alpha release. We simply don't want to misinform you.

## Release flow

A month or so before the release, we will run a closed beta test with some trusted community members.

> You shouldn't ask to be a beta tester, we will choose it ourselves. Whether or not you have donated will have no effect on this. Don't feel left out if you aren't picked - the real, open beta test will be Early Access. Remember that the alpha, when it's out, will still be in early stages of life - as such, it will probably still be buggy enough to give the full range beta-testing experience!

Around the same time, we'll start to publish a lot more gameplay footage, as well as sending the game to our press contacts. You'll definitely get a final idea of what to expect from the game before buying it.

It's at that moment when we will probably post a final, solid release date.

## Thank you!

Big thanks for your support, guys. Special appreciation goes to the kind folks who donate their money to us, not expecting anything in exchange. Especially our [Patrons](https://www.patreon.com/voxeltycoon) — you rock!

This is an incredible journey for us, and we hope we're making it fun enough for you as well.

Around three weeks ago we posted a [State of Affairs](/when) message, where we disclosed the actual state of development and talked about things left to do before we can ship the alpha. Here's a quick reminder of that list, with some added notes on what's changed:


### Final tools

Building tools have greatly improved since last time. There are still some flaws and bugs to work out - for example, you can't build road intersections at the moment. Not cool! But, we are almost there. Given the fact that they've been in the works for almost 6 months, this is great news!

### Modular stations / Hubs

This is done! Woo-hoo!

{% include img.html src="/assets/weekreport/20181013-152913.png" %}

### Finalized UI

UI is receiving a lot of attention right now. It's starting to take shape into its final layout and "look". We are adding more and more working windows to the game - and those are final, for the alpha at least - no more changes required.

### Geological surveying

The concept for surveying is nearly finished, and it's ready for implementation.

### No updates yet

These things are still untouched from last time. However, we are not expecting any major difficulties here:

* Tech Tree / Research and Development
* Electricity
* Pipes / Liquids

## The most recent (and longest!) footage to date

For those who missed it, check out these 15+ minutes of raw footage, recorded from a recent build of the game.

<iframe class="widget-youtube" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eGKbHxh47Y4?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Vehicle physics in action

Those who watched the video above may have noticed that the one piece was missing from our vehicle physics engine - taking load weights into account. Now, when a vehicle is running with more cargo aboard, it will require more power. This is especially noticeable when going uphill:

{% include img.html src="/assets/weekreport/phys2-0.gif" %}

We are finally satisfied with the physics engine, and it can be considered final. We are not going to alter it again until after the first alpha.

## Assets are dead. Long live mods!

One more important milestone here is that built-in assets have been completely replaced with moddable ones!

{% include img.html style="inline-left" src="/assets/weekreport/image_2018-10-11_22-02-48.png" alt="An example of Unity editor extension authored by us to edit built-in assets palette" %}

A bit of history: in the first year of development, we mostly focused on getting a playable prototype to work. Despite the fact we were committed to making the game's content moddable from day one, to make the prototype function, we used assets that relied on Unity's built-in system. It worked well, and we even coded a bunch of Unity Editor extensions to handle these assets.

However, as the base game was established, it was obvious that built-in assets have limitations that we should overcome to make modding as accessible and flexible as possible. So, we developed our own asset pipeline, released with [SDK 2.0](/sdk). Every new asset added since then was developed for the new system and, therefore, is moddable.

Through development, there were a lot of existing old-fashioned assets using the base Unity system. However, every time we've touched stuff related to an asset, like when we need to add new data or behaviour to it, then we take the extra step to convert it to the new system. And today, finally, this process is finished!

## One more thing

After the previous post, we received tremendous support, with people even saying things like *"C'mon, take your time, we'll wait until 3018!"* Hmm, actually, that's an idea... just kidding.

On one hand, you guys are right - the more we work on the game, the more polished it will become. But on the other hand, it's going into Early Access after all, which is meant to, well, give *early access* to games. We've already held back the release for a long time, and we need to draw the line somewhere. At some point, we need to say, "Let's give the game to players and start gathering feedback!" Then we'll fix, improve, update, and repeat. Bugs and problems will be in the alpha anyway, that's why it's an alpha!

Long story short, our goal is to release the game in a few months. Thank you for believing in us, we're doing our best not to fail you.

As usual, we encourage you to join our [Discord](http://discord.gg/64KPWd5) and share your thoughts with us or the community.

{% include img.html src="/assets/weekreport/25.gif" %}

Over the past week we have made a lot of progress on electrified rails. Actually, we went from no implementation at all to working poles distribution and wires rendering. You can even choose on what side the poles should be placed!

{% include img.html src="/assets/weekreport/20181020-131339.png" %}

Vehicle physics produce fun effects here. Although electric trains will not consider unelectrified segments while pathfinding, in "Looking for trouble" mode where vehicles just randomly drive around, they can have enough momentum to skip areas with no electrification.

{% include img.html src="/assets/weekreport/20.gif" %}

The next area we are going to focus on regarding this is the need to power electrified rails by connecting them to an electrical grid, which in turn should be connected to a powerful enough energy source.

Stay tuned for more information about the game! Please [follow our social networks](/contacts), and we encourage you to join our [Discord](http://discord.gg/64KPWd5) and share your thoughts with us or the community.

Halloween is behind us and now we're back to Voxel Tycoon development. While we continue pushing the game toward a closer-than-ever alpha release we invite you to read a little retrospective on how we celebrated this holiday with our community in the past, and especially focus on this year and why it's important.

## Tier 1

This was back in the days when we were working on Voxel Tycoon in our spare time. Not so much effort was put into the Halloween post - we basically recolored some biomes and trees to get the spooky look:

{% include img.html src="/assets/hell-or-high-water/M7USjsCR0AU.jpg" alt="It was the moment when the famous Pumpkin was born" %}

**What we got from it**: 
* Simple themed post
* Some fun

## Tier 2

Next year the celebration caught Voxel Tycoon far deeper in development. We had already left our jobs to that moment, the first iteration of [SDK](/sdk) was released to the community, and an even more important milestone was reached — the game was Greenlit on Steam (just days before the Greenlight system was retired, lol).

This time we put a bit more into the Halloween post and made this annoying GIF that tests your patience. Of course, we added a classic **WHAT WILL HAPPEN? WATCH TILL THE END TO FIND OUT!**  clickbait for more fun.

{% include img.html src="/assets/hell-or-high-water/ezgif-5-0e079f2b4bbf.gif" alt="It actually resembles another <a href=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/Qq8P7OoPYKLXa/giphy.gif\">cool GIF</a>" %}

**What we got from it**: 
* Knowledge how to edit videos using Blender
* More fun
* Nice comments, like:

{% include img.html src="/assets/hell-or-high-water/comments.png" %}

## Tier 3

As some of you may already know, this year we went *a little* further:

{% include img.html src="/assets/hell-or-high-water/rth3_short.gif" %}

Yes, this is an action game built on top of Voxel Tycoon, called **Railroad to Hell 3**. It was developed in less than a week so that it was in time for Halloween 2018.

While simple, it’s absolutely complete: you have to break through dozens of waves of pumpkins that are trying to kill you. You are equipped with 3 completely different weapons, fine-tuned to give you a unique experience and encourage you to use different tactics with each of them. Don’t forget about an upgrade system for 6 stats, 3 tiers of… anyway, you can test it by yourself  [right now](/railroad-to-hell).

### Wait a minute, what the *hell*? Isn't Voxel Tycoon an economy strategy about transportation and factories in a friendly voxel world?
...you may be asking yourself at this point. And it's about that for sure! **Railroad to Hell 3** is a completely independent project (we call it a *spin-off* just for fun). The spin-off, however, was intended to not just entertain but to provide some important benefits to the development of Voxel Tycoon as well.

**What we got from it**

First of all, we chose a completely different genre and setting for a reason. It allowed us to test the extensibility of the engine, i.e. how far mods can be pushed to add new functionality, or change existent. While RTH3 is not true mod at the moment, eventually (some time after the VT alpha release) we want to convert it to complete example that demonstrates modding using both content and custom scripting ways.

> RTH3 uses the same save data as its big brother. This means that when VT will out you could shoot some pumpkins in your own worlds by providing saved games to RTH3.

{% include img.html src="/assets/hell-or-high-water/20181110-205254.png" alt="This is how the level from RTH3 looks like when you play it like a strategy game" %}

Another area where RTH3 was beneficial is explosions. There are not so many of them that happen during the normal life of a tycoon, but in no way can you avoid them in RTH3. We received some valuable intel while destroying enemies and the surrounding environment.

There was one more strong challenge - game design. We started to work on the RTH3 without any grand plan in mind, and through a series of quick, short iterations come to pretty satisfying result.

Finally, distributing the game via itch.io allowed us to setup and test an automated build system that will be in very active use when VT comes out.

At the end, the switch to this completely different project cleaned our heads a bit before the final sprint to the alpha release of Voxel Tycoon.


{% include img.html src="/assets/hell-or-high-water/20181111-003250.png" alt="The Pumpkin has not been left out and received a facelift, 0.00001% performance boost confirmed" %}

## Play now!

In case you haven't yet, we encourage you to go and play it right now while you are waiting for Voxel Tycoon. Of course, if this is your kind of game!

<iframe class="widget-itchio_dark" frameborder="0" src="https://itch.io/embed/324650?linkback=true&amp;border_width=1&amp;bg_color=1e1728&amp;fg_color=ffffff&amp;link_color=b7278c&amp;border_color=4b4455"></iframe>

Keep in mind that all the money from sales go to support of development of Voxel Tycoon. Thank you, and see you in the next post, where we return to the gameplay mechanics of VT!

title: Intro to Transport Hubs
category: devlog
thumb: /assets/posts/20181125-163723.png
---

At the very beginning of the game, the path of a product between its origin (e.g. ore deposit) and a customer is pretty straightforward.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/20181125-155056.png" %}

**1.** Extract ore from the deposit using a Mine facility<br>
**2.** Load it onto the train and deliver it to a station near a city where a customer is located<br>
**3.** Sell the goods directly from a station to a customer<br>

However, this works well only for the simplest cases. The farther the station location from a customer the less profit you will get from such a trade. If the target city is big enough, this will become an issue, as train stations are usually big and it's hard or even impossible to place them close enough to a customer.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/20181125-160708.png" alt="Delivering copper ore to the house on the top will bring much less profit due huge distance from train station" %}

Fortunately, this can be easily fixed with trucks! Truck stations are much smaller so they can perfectly fit into the required spot.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/20181125-161750.png" %}

Now, instead of selling goods directly from the station, we can unload them into trucks first and then deliver directly to customers to obtain maximum profit. And this is where *Transport Hubs* come into play.

The Transport Hub is a group of adjacent buildings (*hub modules*) that can transfer goods between each other without any medium. To form a hub all that is needed is to build a truck station next to an existing train station.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/20181125-162016.png" %}

Now all the stuff from trains may be loaded into trucks and delivered almost directly to a customer.

The other case where hubs are essential is when you need to store goods instead of selling or unloading them immediately. Warehouses come to the rescue!

In the example above the train will wait until fully unloaded, and because trucks have much less capacity it will take a huge amount of time. While acceptable, this may be not the behavior you are looking for.

The solution is to add a warehouse to our hub that will serve as a buffer. Now the train will unload directly into the warehouse, instead of into the trucks, decreasing the time taken so it can move off more quickly.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/20181125-162331.png" %}

There's one occurrence where you just cannot do without warehouses. It's factories! Selling unprocessed ores is ok, but if you want nearby cities (and your own empire) to grow, you'll need to produce more complex goods.

The basic factory requires two warehouses - one to take source materials from and the other for storing the final product. They should be connected with conveyors, with some processing devices in the middle.

> Keep in mind that factories solely belong to one hub, so you can't just connect hubs in different cities with conveyors and sidestep all the transport stuff.

Of course, this is not all that hubs are capable of doing, but this post is already too huge. Thanks for reading this far, and see you next time!

title: Consists Editor and Thoughts on Release
category: devlog
thumb: /assets/consists-editor/pic1.png
---

We believe that you can get an overall idea of how deep the transport game is just by looking at how the process of buying transport is implemented. Let's take a look at the implementation that we've prepared for the first release of Voxel Tycoon.

## Welcome the Consists Editor!

{% include img.html src="/assets/consists-editor/pic0.png" %}

This is the window you'll use to buy new vehicles or reconfigure already owned ones. Let's go through some features it provides, besides allowing the player to take a glimpse at some summary information of the vehicle.

### Adding units

When you hit the add button you are presented with a picker with all available units to choose from.

{% include img.html src="/assets/consists-editor/pic1.png" %}

They are split into three categories:

* Unpowered
* <span style="color: #52d900">Powered</span>
* <span style="color: #af5fff">Advanced MU</span>

If the first two speak for themselves, the last one may require some explaination. We'll cover it later in this post.

You can filter by these categories, or also by engine type:

{% include img.html src="/assets/consists-editor/pic2.png" %}

Another feature that probably will be used often is this picker:

{% include img.html src="/assets/consists-editor/pic13.png" %}

You can choose the cargo you wish to transport and it will show you all the units that can handle it. Moreover, it automatically sets the unit purpose when it's added to the consist.

Not all units can be connected to each other because they have different types of couplings. For example, trailers can be connected only to compatible trucks. This is handled for you by Consists Editor as well: it will filter units so only compatible ones are left in the list.

### Editing

This is called Editor for a reason, right? So, you can select some of units and a handy actions panel will pop up:

{% include img.html src="/assets/consists-editor/pic3.png" %}

You can remove, flip, duplicate, or replace selected units, or you can insert a new unit before a selected one.

Also, you can change the purpose for carriages using the little picker above each of them.

And, of course, it allows you to change the vehicle name.

### Advanced MU

Another interesting feature is support for advanced multiple unit systems. While we obviously support basic MUs where more than one powered units provide motive power to the train, there's nothing special about them. So what makes Advanced MUs so... *advanced*?

{% include img.html src="/assets/consists-editor/pic4.png" %}

This third kind of unit stands out because it has a pretty strict structure, which is what makes it special. It consists of many sections, with each of these sections possibly containing both powered and unpowered units. Most importantly, some of the sections may have a variable amount of carriages in it. And for such type of vehicles, special controls will appear in the UI.

{% include img.html src="/assets/consists-editor/pic5.png" %}

> We are not sure if *Advanced MU* is the best term for such kind of units. If you have an idea of what the naming should be, feel free to let us know on [Discord](http://discord.gg/64KPWd5).

### Conclusion

Of course, all of the behaviors described above are controlled by vehicle authors, so modders can configure their units in a way they see fit best. For example, they may prohibit using *Advanced MU* carriages outside of such advanced consists, or may not, so the player can build up the fully custom train by itself. Or, custom couplings may be created by the mod author for even more control and flexibility.

Hope you'll like this way of handling vehicle consists. At least, it's a far cry from the old one:

{% include img.html src="/assets/consists-editor/pic7.png" %}

## Thoughts on release

You may suspect that the release is not going to happen this year. Although, to give you a clue how close it is, we want to announce that the preparation for the first wave of closed pre-alpha roll-out has started. It's a very exciting time as the game finally gets to be played by more than a few people.

If you are interested in participating in the next beta testing waves please fill out [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/kuKwtznETxmAbZMG3). Be advised: playing the pre-alpha version of the Early Access game means a very unfinished experience that most likely will ruin the first impression of the game. So, you should apply only if you really want to spoil all the things and get deep into testing.

Bearing in mind approaching release and all the work that should be done before that, we have no free time to prepare you any holiday presents this Christmas. However, we bet the best gift possible is VT coming into Early Access, albeit a bit late. So, let us wish you Merry Christmas and Happy New Year in advance, while we keep working on getting the game to you.

Quite a lot of stuff has happened since our last post. Here's a quick recap of recent events.

## Pre-alpha is real!

We've started rolling with the very first wave of pre-alpha testing!

These are completely untested builds of the game, filled with issues and very limited gamplay. Despite this, it's a very important step for us, as we have started to receive actual feedback on our work. It's actually very useful!

As a result, we've uncovered lots of things to update, fix and improve. We push at least one new build almost every day to our testers.

> **UPDATE 1 JUN 2019:** You can read info about each game update and changes on the [special secret page](/changelog).

{% include img.html src="/assets/january-update/20190130-205749.png" alt="Sneak peak of build changelogs" %}

There really is a lot of work we still have to do, but once we're done with pre-alpha, we're going to start the next wave of full alpha tests. If you're interested, stay tuned — we'll announce that officially a bit later!

## Cargoes

In case you missed it, we've added a few new products (actually, over 20 😱) to mine, transport, process, build and sell in the first alpha.

{% include img.html src="/assets/january-update/items.png" alt="Current list of items available in the game" %}

We're also finally satisfied with the flow of cargo through stations, vehicles and storage. Among other things, it's now very easy to add new cargoes as mods.

{% include img.html src="/assets/january-update/image_2019-01-30_22-07-57.png" alt="The Train of Everything" %}

## Accessibility

To provide a more player-friendly experience, we've started to add a lot of little things to help out: tooltips, hotkey hints, localization, and so on.

{% include img.html src="/assets/january-update/image_2019-01-30_22-10-43.png" alt="Brand new hotkey hints" %}

## Closer to final UI

We're continuing to apply the final look and feel to game windows.

{% include img.html src="/assets/january-update/20190105-2.png" alt="HUD and Budget Window" %}

Finally, save and load interface has arrived! Of course, we couldn't resist from adding little details like preview images for your saves:

{% include img.html src="/assets/january-update/image_2019-01-30_22-17-15.png" alt="Load Game Window" %}

And, of course, the settings window:

{% include img.html src="/assets/january-update/image_2019-01-30_22-18-09.png" alt="Cheats included" %}

## In case you missed it

Depots! Yes, we added them to the game! We've even had a chance to update the train one to make it a little bit longer 😉

{% include img.html src="/assets/january-update/image_2019-01-30_22-51-00.png" %}

And one more pretty important thing: custom animations support for vehicles and buildings. Just look at this cutie 😍

{% include img.html src="/assets/january-update/39.gif" %}

That's all for now. See you next time!

title: Economy in Pre-Alpha
category: devlog
thumb: /assets/economy/20190512-181104.png
---

*It's been a while since the last blog we posted, and that's because we have been working very hard and simply couldn't find a time to write any posts. The reason we have been working so hard is that the first public pre-alpha is very close and we are making sure everything is ready. So we thought we would walk you through the different core features of the game, so you are ready when it launches. And that's what we will be doing in the upcoming blog posts.*

First off, we'll take a brief look at the economy system, which has undergone quite a few changes since we last mentioned it.

Your primary source of money will be Demands. They appear in towns, and will give you money in exchange for delivering goods. If you provide enough cargo to satisfy their requirements, they will slowly "level up" and accept more cargo. These upgrades are also influenced by town size, with each upgrade requiring higher population. On the other hand, if its needs are not met, the Demand's level will decay until it finally goes bankrupt and closes down.

{% include img.html src="/assets/economy/20190512-181104.png" alt="A demand requesting Coal" %}

There is a catch, though - you can't just pour all the goods you produce into a single Demand. The reason being is that VT's economy operates under a simplified supply and demand model. The more goods you deliver to a single location, the less money you will receive - and ultimately, the Demand's storage will fill up and they won't accept any more cargo. These numbers are separate for each Demand, and you can find them in their respective overview windows.

{% include img.html src="/assets/economy/20190513-212520.png" alt="Demand overview window" %}

So we have covered how you make money with Demands, but they serve another important purpose - making towns grow. How do they do that?

{% include img.html src="/assets/economy/20190513-214348.png" alt="Town overview window" %}

Quite simply, actually. Towns will grow a tiny bit faster for each Demand that has its requirements satisfied each month. But these requirements will increase over time, as described above, so it will take more and more effort to grow the town as it gets bigger. Another reason is that as the town grows, more Demands will appear, more specifically ones from higher tiers. These accept goods that are created using factories that need to be researched and built beforehand, but in turn pay a lot more money.

{% include img.html src="/assets/economy/20190512133026_1.jpg" alt="We will talk about factories and the whole processing part of the game in one of the upcoming blogs" %}

Another big thing to note is that there is a limit of 2 Demands of each tier per city. When you are producing more goods than a single Demand requires, you will have to find another one of the same type in another town. This encourages you to expand your network and focus on many different supply chains at once. So, if you want to sell all 7 of the tier 2 materials, you will need at minimum 4 towns that grew to a size sufficient for them to appear.

{% include img.html src="/assets/economy/20190512132654_1.jpg" %}

Lastly we will touch a bit on modding related stuff. You can of course add your own custom demands, you can specify the material requested, the amounts of it, the price ranges, the buildings used for the demands, and basically everything else. You can even edit the base game demands if you so desire.

Next time, we will focus on the factories. If you want to discuss this post with over **2000** other people interested in Voxel Tycoon, or if you have questions for the developers or people who have access to the closed alpha version, you're welcome to join our [Discord](http://discord.gg/64KPWd5) server!

{% include img.html src="/assets/devlog/factories/conveyor3.gif" %}

*All the stuff described in this post applies for open pre-alpha, that is going to start soon on itch.io. Everything is subject to change and improvement before hitting Steam Early Access.*

Last time, we [covered the game's economy](/devlog/economy). Today we will be looking at another core building block of Voxel Tycoon: Factories!

But before we dive in, we have to cover the raw materials that you'll be processing. Throughout the world you will find patches and deposits of them, usually one in each region; with the exception of the starting region which is guaranteed to have the most basic resources: iron ore, wood, stone, and coal. To extract these resources you'll have to build a mine, a sawmill or other industries that are specific to each raw material.

{% include img.html src="/assets/devlog/factories/image_2019-05-24_18-57-11.png" alt="Coal mining facility (not final assets)" %}

Now we can get to the good stuff: processing! As you probably already know, unlike most transportation tycoons, there are no prebuilt industries that spawn in the world. In VT, you'll build your own, using various components like furnaces for smelting ores, saws for cutting wood, warehouses for storage and conveyor belts for movement and production lines.

This affords incredible flexibility in the flow and shipment of raw materials and products. For instance, small-scale factories could be built onsite in a city or at a mineral deposit, or enormous hubs with huge production could be built, sending and receiving goods to and from all over the map. Both methods do have their advantages and disadvantages, however - the capacities of railcars and road vehicles differ for each material, so for some of them it makes more sense to process them at the destination and for others the opposite is true.

{% include img.html src="/assets/devlog/factories/20190522214942_1.jpg" alt="Small factory near the wood log" %}

Now, you might think that building factories is a big hassle, so why bother? Well, as we already covered last time, processed materials have a *much* higher value, which increases with each Tier - more on that in a moment - and are also used in the research progression system.

{% include img.html src="/assets/devlog/factories/image_2019-05-24_19-11-46.png" alt="Laboratory awaiting for resources to start the research" %}

Voxel Tycoon's research system is tied very closely together with factories and production. Since you'll only have basic materials to and virtually no factory equipment to worry about at first in a new game, you can comfortably get a basic network going in your starting region. In order to make any kind of progress, you have to start doing research. Which costs you not only money but also materials, and as you progress through the technology tree you will need more advanced materials to keep going. These technologies will reward you with new machines and new recipes for them.

{% include img.html src="/assets/devlog/factories/image_2019-05-24_19-08-07.png" alt="A little factory producing middle tier goods" %}

Now, let's take a brief look at how you go about actually building a factory. The most used part will definitely be the conveyor belt, which is pretty self-explanatory. They slowly move a stream of items from one spot to another and can be joined and configured in any way you can imagine. The possibilities are endless!

{% include img.html src="/assets/devlog/factories/conveyor2.gif" alt="Pointless, but why not?" %}

When building machines, you'll see that they have a number of conveyor connections. Each of these can act as either an input or an output, and you can change which is which with the same tool you change any conveyor's orientation with. After that, all you have to do is give the machine the recipe you want it to execute, hook up some conveyers to give it the items it needs, and off it goes!

Most machines have more than two conveyer connections, for example the Furnace which has three. One input should be used for fuel (coal), and the other for ore.

{% include img.html src="/assets/devlog/factories/image_2019-05-24_18-54-02.png" alt="Smelting plant" %}

Lastly, let's talk about modding possibilities. You can add custom raw materials, machines, and even recipes - not just for your own machines, but also base game and even other mods'! You can also add other related technologies for production, but we will expand on that another time.

{% include img.html src="/assets/devlog/factories/20190524-193859.png" alt="An example of end-game factory (courtesy of Alego22)" %}

As the first public alpha release draws ever closer, we will continue to talk about Voxel Tycoon's core mechanics in more blog posts, so you can jump straight into the game when it finally ships.

Hey!

You may have noticed that the pace of updates has declined recently. Just after the release of pre-alpha, we worked on eliminating the most critical shortcomings that significantly interfered with playing. But now we are ready to deal with bigger updates and adding more and more new content.

For example, we are currently working on passenger transportation and mass vehicle management. Of course, the larger the update, the more time it takes to prepare it.

Initially, we planned to release a new update with mass vehicle management at the end of this month. But, unfortunately, the plan did not work - one of the developers seriously injured his arm and therefore underwent surgery. He is already recovering, but the update release had to be postponed.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/bone.png" alt="It hurts ☠️" %}

But don’t worry! This is a temporary hitch that will not interfere with our long-term development plans for Voxel Tycoon.

Sadly, we had no time to prepare something special for this Halloween. Anyways, please [take a look at how we celebrated it in previous years](/devlog/spooky-driven-development) — especially 2018, where we've introduced the official spinoff to Voxel Tycoon, which is available to play now! 🎃

**UPDATE**: This post was our April Fool's Day joke! We hope you enjoyed the fun.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/anticheat.png" %}

Due to constantly increasing use of cheats in the game (<kbd>Ctrl+Alt+C</kbd>) we've decided to take action and stop players from gaining an unfair advantage.

Starting today, the new anti-cheat system will be enabled for all players to enforce fair play.

Introducing <b>VoxelWatch™ Anti-Cheat Enforcer</b>! Powered by top-notch neural networks, it will ban players permanently if the usage of cheats will be detected.

Please keep in mind that due to high amount of detected cases bans will be spread out in waves. If you used cheats and your account still hasn't banned, just give the system some time. Nobody is safe!

Thanks for your cooperation, and stay home!

It’s hard to believe that - after four years of development - we are finally standing at the gate of Steam Early Access. But it’s true!

Our focus is now shifted from updating the current version that is available on Itch (called *Pre-Alpha*) to finishing features that separate us from bringing the game to Steam Early Access (we call that stage *the Alpha*).

We already briefly announced our plans with the release of [0.80](/changelog#0.80) version of the game, stating that was the last update before the game is available on Steam.

However, we don't want to completely exclude you - our beloved players and modders - from getting your hands on the new features for the whole period while we'll be busy working on bringing the Alpha to Steam.

## New update pace

While we are working on Steam EA release, new builds are still going to be released, but they will no longer be big updates. [0.80.1](/changelog#0.80.1) is a great example of such an update.

This also means that new releases may happen more often than it was before. We recommend you to install the game via [Itch App](//itch.io/app) to keep it always up-to-date without any hassle.

> If you bought the game without registering, you can always [restore you purchase](https://itch.io/docs/buying/already-bought) and link the game to your Itch account that you use to login to the Itch App.  

## Modding and Steam Workshop

The Alpha will feature **Steam Workshop** integration, so sharing your work with the community never been more streamlined. We encourage you to start making your mods today so they'll be ready for the Alpha release.

For those who don't know where to start, the new guide just has been published (thanks *scailman*!): [Creating your first content mod](https://docs.voxeltycoon.xyz/guides/content-mods/creating-your-first-building-mod/).

Also, check out our new home for modding documentation: [Voxel Tycoon modding documentation](/modding).

## Follow the roadmap

You can always get an idea of what features are still needed to be done before Steam Early Access on [our roadmap](/roadmap). Check the column **Before Steam EA** and look for `[DONE]`tags on cards.

## Stay tuned!

We are so glad to see you guys taking this journey together with us. Don’t forget, that the Alpha is just a beginning for our little project, and we have so much to bring to Voxel Tycoon after the game reaches Steam Early Access.

If you didn't yet, join our [Discord server](//discord.gg/voxeltycoon), and follow us on your favorite social media to keep up to date!

See ya!

Today's post covers some modding-related news that happened in the last weeks.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/modding.gif" alt="Old School Style mod in action" %}

## Official modding documentation

We've finally set up our brand new home for modding documentation.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/modding-1.png" %}

Please welcome: [docs.voxeltycoon.xyz](//docs.voxeltycoon.xyz). No so much covered there yet, but we are constantly working on bringing new topics, guides, and reference documentation for you.

Also, if you feel like you could contribute to the docs, please give it a shot! You can suggest edits for specific pages (see that pencil icon at the top of every page?), or create completely new pages with new guides and manuals by cloning the [backing repository](https://github.com/voxeltycoon/docs/) and opening pull requests.

## Community guides

Thank to amazing work of our community member **scailman**, we already have a few community made tutorials, very helpful for beginners in Voxel Tycoon modding:

* [Creating your first building mod](http://docs.voxeltycoon.xyz/guides/content-mods/creating-your-first-building-mod/)
* [Creating your first locomotive mod](http://docs.voxeltycoon.xyz/guides/content-mods/creating-your-first-locomotive-mod/)
* [Creating your first truck mod](http://docs.voxeltycoon.xyz/guides/content-mods/creating-your-first-truck-mod/)
* [Animating locomotive rods](http://docs.voxeltycoon.xyz/guides/content-mods/animating-locomotive-rods/)

We also recommend to check mods made by **scailman** in the modding gallery - they are awesome!

## Official mods

We love mods so much, so even created a couple by ourselves.

<div class="img-inline-left-container" style="width: 148px">
    <img src="/assets/posts/modding-2.png" style="margin-bottom: 6px" />

    <span class="img-alt">Make the game older by 20 years thanks to nostalgic old school styled vehicles movement.</span>
</div>

<br style="clear: both;">

Of course, their main purpose is educational. Source code for our mods is now [available on GitHub](https://github.com/voxeltycoon/mods), along with samples from modding guides from the modding docs. Feel free to explore it!

## #mods Discord channel

We've also set up a channel on [our Discord Server](//discord.gg/voxeltycoon) that automatically lets members know when new mods get released or updated.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/modding-4.png" %}

## That's it by now!

More modding-related updates are planned, so stay tuned! And please wishlist Voxel Tycoon on Steam, if you didn't yet:

As you may already know, Voxel Tycoon is just one update away from hitting Steam Early Access. And this time, we mean it!

This will differ quite a bit from our usual updates, though. A successful Steam launch is crucial for VT's future development, so we can't afford to rush it.

Besides many quality of life improvements in preparation for Steam, VT will now feature a brand new game mechanic - **passenger transportation**! This involves many changes and lots of new content, like the new vehicles and stations that will be unlocked with research.

There're some other things up our sleeves as well, such as Steam Workshop integration, and some other unannounced changes and improvements. All of this is bringing the update far past its original scale.

## Radio silence

With all of that said, and as you can probably imagine, a large amount of work is required to make such an important update. A lot of it is already done, but a lot is still in the works, too. And given the amount of things changing all at once, we can't realistically predict how much more time we need (it should at least be this year!). Like any complex mechanism, we can't say it works as intended - i.e. playing the game is fun enough - until all of the parts are done and connected together.

And that's why you don't hear from us very often these days. We're busy! This is probably one of the most important times in Voxel Tycoon's life, and our own lives, too.

## Just a beginning

We really can't thank you enough for taking this journey with us through VT's development. But this is just the start - we are committed to bringing [even more content](https://voxeltycoon.xyz/roadmap) to Voxel Tycoon after the game reaches Early Access!

Also, big thanks to our beloved modders, bringing new content to the game almost every day. You are so cool and talented, and some of your creations so creative and clever that we can't help but be amazed. Keep up the great work!

In [0.79](/changelog#0.79) we have introduced C# mods support. Finally, enthusiasts who don’t want to limit themselves to creating content-based mods may get their hands on tools allowing them to add new or modify existent logic and behaviors of Voxel Tycoon.

While modification of game code was already possible by patching game library files, this update introduces a streamlined way to pack your custom code into distributable mods.

The proper documentation of the APIs is still lacking, but **we highly encourage you to start bringing your ideas to life and give us feedback on what new APIs, hooks, events, and any other changes you need**.

Good luck, have fun!

Before getting you straight to beautiful shots of the heavily modded game made by our [community members](//discord.gg/voxeltycoon) playing Pre-Alpha, there's a quick state of development report:

> No ETA on the Steam EA yet, but we are working hard to deliver as soon as possible. A lot of things should be done right, such as a tutorial, Steam Workshop integration, and passenger transportation. We can't fail with the Steam EA launch, so we take our time.

Now, enjoy the awesome community work!

Not only for the whole world experiencing a global pandemic but also for us - an indie team of two guys doing our best to ship our precious game to the broader audience.

Since we made Pre-Alpha available for everyone interested we have released 14 free major updates, improving the game in every aspect. Then, we took a pause to work on the biggest update we've ever made - an update that will bring the game into Steam Early Access.

You know how this major milestone is important for Voxel Tycoon's future development. We just can't afford to rush it - but at the same time, we still can't work in a relaxed manner since we know how bad you want to play it. Believe us, there's no such day when we go to sleep without thinking of what we'll do tomorrow to bring Voxel Tycoon closer to the EA release.

Even those of you who bought the Pre-Alpha access (thank you!) still patiently waiting for the new update, which - by the way - will bring:

{% include img.html src="/assets/oof/changelog.png" style="inline-right" alt="Changelog for the version currently in testing compared to 0.84.1 (Itch version). Intentionally unreadable 😜" %}

* Passengers!
* Tutorial
* Steam Workshop
* Logistics improvements

...and many other changes!

Closed beta testing of the update is already undergoing, we mostly finished new game mechanics at this point and most of UI (fun fact: making good UI takes a lot of time on its own). While we definitely not going to make it before the new year (sorry), we are confident to say that the waiting is coming to the end.

We can't thank you enough for believing in us and being with us in such important moments, and in return, we work really hard to not disappoint you.

That being said, we wish you happy holidays with your family and friends, and we hope to see you soon™! Cheers! 🎄

## Bonus

Our regular in-game photograph Fredrik Leftin can’t help but surprise us and the community every time he prepares stunning shots from the carefully crafted sceneries.

This time, he prepared something special - an entire scenery of a railway terminal from different points of view and even… from different epochs! Enjoy.

Hello fellow tycoons! The time for a new state-of-things report has come.

Do you remember that pretty unreadable changelog we shared a month ago in the [previous post]({% post_url 2020-12-28-oof %})? It summarizes all the changes from 0.84 (Itch version) to the point when closed beta started:

{% include img.html src="/assets/oof/changelog.png" %}

Since then, we've added a few more changes to it:

{% include img.html src="/assets/quick-dev-update/log.png" %}

As you can see, it's still unreadable (on purpose, as usual). However, there's one thing we can't hide from you:

{% include img.html src="/assets/quick-dev-update/steam_workshop.png" %}

Yep, we've reached a new milestone: Steam Workshop integration is fully completed! We can't wait to get you all on board so you can explore the community-made content in a convenient way, and even share your own creations with ease to a broader audience.

This also means that we have only one major task left before going to Steam EA - the tutorial. Of course, there's a bunch of fixes, tweaks, and balance tuning still required here and there, but we finally started to see the light at the end of the tunnel. And that's good.

That's it for today. We'll keep you informed about how progress is going, and see you next time!

This is the first installment of the series of posts where we cover the new features and changes the upcoming **0.85** (aka **Steam Early Access**) update delivers to Voxel Tycoon:
* Logistics network
* [A new way to set up a schedule](/devlog/vehicle-window-facelift/)
* [Passengers!](/devlog/passengers/)

## Logistics overhaul

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/logistics-network/5.mp4" %}

In this update, we completely revamp how buildings and vehicles interact with each other.

Mines, stations, labs, and warehouses are now part of the brand new logistics network that enables an interchange of items between these buildings in a similar manner. The new system provides a fair and controllable distribution of cargo between these buildings. In addition, it also introduces new ways of interaction between them.

For example, any of said buildings now can be connected to conveyors, so, for example, a mine can output resources directly to a conveyor belt. The same applies to any station, a lab, etc. Or, they can even exchange cargo directly (in some range) without any intermediate warehouses. This enables cases that were not possible previously, like moving cargo between a train and a truck without any intermediate storage.

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/logistics-network/1.mp4" %}

Another building that greatly benefits from this is the lab: it can now accept goods directly from stations or conveyors without the need to build warehouses around them.

## Logistics UI

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/logistics-network/6.mp4" %}

A new Logistics tab was added to all buildings that are part of the logistics network. On this tab, you can see at a glance what cargo is available or requested by the network of connected buildings. Also, it enables an overlay where all the connections are shown visually.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/logistics-network/1.png" alt="No more wondering if a new customer that just opened falls into the range of your station or not!" %}

## Mine, warehouse, and device UI

All the buildings that historically were missing UI finally got it!

Mine window:
{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/logistics-network/4.png" %}

Device window:
{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/logistics-network/2.png" %}

Warehouse window:
{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/logistics-network/3.png" %}

## That's it for today!

Stay tuned for the next post to discover what to expect from the next major milestone for Voxel Tycoon and the whole community!

---

This is the second installment of the series of posts where we cover the new features and changes the upcoming **0.85** (aka **Steam Early Access**) update delivers to Voxel Tycoon:
* [Logistics network](/devlog/logistics-network/)
* A new way to set up a schedule
* [Passengers!](/devlog/passengers/)

With 0.85, the Vehicle Window receives a huge facelift:

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/vehicle-window-facelift/1.png" %}

Some changes are already obvious, but let's switch to Edit mode and see what it reveals.

## Stops and orders

From 0.85, you can set multiple orders per one stop. It helps to group related orders and manipulate them as one piece.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/vehicle-window-facelift/3.png" %}

After a stop has been added to the schedule, you can add as many orders as you want. A vehicle will execute all of them after arriving at this stop.

There are also a few useful presets, allowing you quickly add common orders to the schedule.

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/vehicle-window-facelift/2.mp4" %}

Additionally, you can now change the order of stops or orders just by dragging them around.

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/vehicle-window-facelift/5.mp4" %}

There're some other improvements too:

- Hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> to add many stops to the schedule at once
- Added **Wait for N seconds** order
- Option to force a vehicle to turn around at the stop
- When you pick exact cars to apply an order to, you can see what kind of cargo they are moving

## Waypoints

Sometimes the automatic pathfinding doesn't suit your needs, and you might want to direct your vehicles through the exact locations of your network. Previously, this involved building expensive and space-consuming intermediate stations.

Now, there's a new kind of station at your disposal, the only purpose of which is to serve as a waypoint. It's cheap and takes no extra space!

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/vehicle-window-facelift/7.png" %}

Also, previously, a vehicle arriving at a station always performed a complete stop even it's intended to just pass through it. A lot of precious time and power were wasted as a result.

But no more! When adding a stop to your schedule, just choose a preset called **Waypoint**. This way, a vehicle will pass the destination without any delay. You can also force this behavior manually in the new picker at the interface of the stop.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/vehicle-window-facelift/6.png" %}

Both special waypoint stations and regular stations could be set up as waypoints.

## Route management improvements

While we don't have a full-featured route management window yet, we've made some improvements to the current route picker.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/vehicle-window-facelift/5.png" %}

The first thing you'll notice is that the color of the route is now more readable, but there's more.

From the new three-dots menu, you can now see a list of all the vehicles attached to the exact route.

Also, removing the last vehicle from a route no longer automatically removes a route, so you can be sure your precisely set orders won't be lost. To remove the routes no longer needed, use the three-dots menu in the route picker.

And the last related improvement allows you to remove a vehicle from a route, but keep its schedule. Cloning routes now will be a bit easier.

## Vehicle Details tab facelift

The Details tab of the Vehicle Window received a facelift too, and now has a more modern look that is in line with the other windows in the game.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/vehicle-window-facelift/4.png" %}

## Bonus

This is the third installment of the series of posts where we cover the new features and changes the upcoming **0.85** (aka **Steam Early Access**) update delivers to Voxel Tycoon:
* [Logistics network](/devlog/logistics-network/)
* [A new way to set up a schedule](/devlog/vehicle-window-facelift/)
* Passengers!

## Passengers are arriving to Voxel Tycoon

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/passengers/3.png" %}

In every house in the city, there are people living! And they don't just sit tight in their flats but have a desire to commute to other places and eventually get back.
Now, it's your responsibility to enable them to reach their destinations. And there's a whole new fleet of vehicles specific to transferring passengers ready to help, from buses to passenger rail cars to hi-end multiple-unit shuttle trains!

After you build a station in a city, hop into its window to see passengers that would like to take a ride from that station and where they want to go.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/passengers/4.png" %}

## Back and forth traverse mode

A usual passenger route often goes through many stops in one city where a bus collects all the available passengers, and then they are transferred to many stops in the other city. Then the same has to be repeated backward.

This results in massive schedules with many stops repeated which is a bit cumbersome to set up and maintain. To address this, we've introduced alternative schedule traverse order, called Back and Forth.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/passengers/6.png" %}

When it's enabled, a vehicle will traverse from the top of the schedule to the bottom and then back, resulting in a much more compact list of orders with the same functionality.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/passengers/5.png" alt="Same schedule with default traverse order vs Back and forth" %}

## Shuttle trains

Shuttle trains are trains that have driving cabs on both sides, and that allows them to move on both sides at full speed without changing their direction on stations.
This feature was already introduced in one of the previous updates, but it didn't have many applications before. Now, with passenger trains added, and especially in conjunction with back and forth schedules, shuttle trains allow to build more clean and effective designs.

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/passengers/3.mp4" %}

## City Window update

We've completely reworked the city window for 0.85. You can now see the state of all aspects of the city's well-being, including the new passenger card.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/passengers/1.png" %}

Not to mention, it has a new look which is in line with other game windows now.

## City specialization

Another thing that you can notice from the City Window is the city type. From 0.85, each city will have one of these types: industrial, tourist, or mixed.

**Industrial cities** depend more on supplying stores and industries for rapid growth, with passenger transportation still contributing but to a lesser extent. 

**Tourist cities**, in contradiction, more dependent on the coverage by passenger transport and passenger satisfaction.

**Mixed cities** depend on both of these aspects equally.

## Auto-demolish and auto-level

To make placing stations easier in the dense city environment, we've enabled auto-demolish when you're building them. Keep in mind that demolishing city buildings still costs money (a lot), so plan carefully! 
Another feature is auto-level - it will help you to place a building in a bumpy environment - but again, for your money!

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/passengers/2.png" alt="Mountain branch line by Fredrik Leftin" %}

## Can't wait for your feedback

That's just our first attempt at how we see passengers. We plan to iterate on them during the Early Access: for example, in the short-term, we want to teach passengers to switch vehicles and even modes so you could build more sophisticated and interesting routes.
We can't wait to get your hands on the 0.85 update and hear your thoughts. Oh, and we have something to announce soon, so stick around!

## FAQ

### It says there're no keys available

Keys are added in batches, so if there're no keys left at the moment, that means we are working on adding the next batch. Please give it some time and try again later.

### I've activated the key but can't download the game!

The game will be available to download and play on April 15.

### What will happen with Itch version, will it be upgraded to 0.85?

We are a small team with limited resources, and we want to focus on the Steam version at the moment. That being said, the Itch version will not be longer updated. Please claim a Steam key and install the game via Steam to get the latest versions, and have Steam Workshop support.

### What will happen with mods in the Mod Gallery in the Itch version?

Mod Gallery in the Itch version will be disabled soon after the Steam Early Access release. If you are a mod author, we encourage you to move your mods to the Steam Workshop, where you'll get great discovery and acknowledgment of your work.

First of all, we thank you from the bottom of our hearts 💜 Without you, our little project wouldn't be possible. You supported us in the pre-alpha stage, you support us now with the Early Access, and we hope to see you later with the full release in the coming years.

Thank you! And we really mean it.

Of course, the development is nowhere stops with the Early Acess release, and we're already working on the next update.

In the meantime, we've been a bit overwhelmed with the amount of feedback that poured on us on every channel, from Discord to Steam Discussions. It was literally impossible for us to answer every question and suggestion, so we decided to compile the most frequent issues into one FAQ, which you can read below.

We also want to thank anyone who spent their time answering questions and helping people here and there. Special thanks go to **scailman**, **refreshfr**, **Elvis Cooper**, and **UGH Dany**.

## General

### If I bought the pre-alpha on Itch previously, should I buy it again on Steam?

No, you don't need to buy the game twice, it's already yours. Follow [these instructions](https://voxeltycoon.xyz/devlog/claim-steam-key/) to claim your Steam key.

### The price is too steep for me. Will the game be on sale?

We have no plans to participate in sales. We believe that the current price properly reflects our intention for long-term support and development of the game.

If you are having trouble deciding if the game is worth your money, please look for some videos on YouTube, read reviews, or even ask other players for opinions directly on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/voxeltycoon)!

### The game is not loading or there's another technical issue

Check the [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/voxeltycoon/issues/discussions/650) page.

### Where can I get help with gameplay?
The best place to get help is our [official Discord server](https://discord.gg/voxeltycoon). In the meantime, you can check the [community guides](https://steamcommunity.com/app/732050/guides/).

### How can I  help?

* **Leave a review.** We are getting many nice words about the game on mail, Discord, etc. We encourage you to leave reviews on Steam if you haven't yet, it helps a lot!
* **Answer questions.** Help other people on Discord, Steam Discussions, etc.
* **Write guides on Steam.** If you are pretty familiar with the game, your insight knowledge may be very helpful for newcomers.
* **Proofread and improve translations.**  To do so, [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/voxeltycoon), then go to [our translation portal](http://translate.voxeltycoon.xyz/) and suggest changes. You can even translate to a completely new language. If you need help, use `#translation` channel.
* **Spread the word.** Tell your friends that could be interested in the game. If you're a content creator and want to request a press key, please fill out the form on [this page](https://voxeltycoon.xyz/press).

## Development

### How many people are on the team?

The game is developed by just two guys. But we can't fail to mention the important role of our community volunteers helping us with content for the game, translations, moderations, writing guides, and more!

### Can you say if some feature is planned?

Please take a look at [our roadmap](/roadmap) to get the idea of what major features are planned and in what order we plan to implement them.

### Can I participate in the early beta of the next updates?

Sure! We'll set up a beta branch on Steam soon, so everyone interested can receive future updates early and give us immediate feedback.

### Where to report bugs or suggest ideas?

The [Voxel Tycoon Issue Tracker](/issues) is the right place.

Before posting, please check [the roadmap](/roadmap) for if the feature you want to suggest already planned and check on GitHub if it's already posted.

## Gameplay

### I have hard times building bridges, connecting roads, etc.

We feel you! The current system - which is responsible for roads, rails, bridges, conveyors, etc - was originally introduced in the early days of the pre-alpha, and it was our 3rd attempt on building tracks already from the moment development begins.

While it was time-proven as a working solution for handling most of the tasks, it obviously has its limitations and can be cumbersome to use at times.

To address that, we are working on a new system, that eventually will replace the current one. Not only it should make building a much more pleasant experience, but introduce many new interesting features, like so:
* Level crossings
* Customizable curvature of tracks
* Left-hand traffic
* Diagonal roads
* One-way roads
* Horizontally curved bridges and tunnels
* Planning mode
* Support for blueprints
* Performance optimizations

and more.

### Why are there no level crossings?

See the answer above.

### I think the signals are working wrong!

Signals are battle-tested for a couple of years already, so we are pretty confident there are no major bugs. The implementation Voxel Tycoon utilizes is called **block signals**, which may the source of confusion for players who are more familiar with other implementations.

There're two common issues that unprepared player might face:
* **A train can't find the way to its destination.** Usually, this is caused by a one-way signal facing the opposite direction. You should have a second signal on the opposite side of the rail if you want to allow a train to pass the track in both directions.
* **A signal is red, even though it seems there's no other train blocking the way.** Usually, this happens when two parallel rails are built too close to each other. Even if they do not intersect visually, the system detects a possible collision and blocks a train from passing. This behavior will be improved with the track system upgrade described above.

Learn more on how signals work and how to build advanced designs:
* [Basic Signaling guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2459842479)
* [Signals wiki article](https://voxeltycoon.fandom.com/wiki/Signals)
* [Video tutorial](https://youtu.be/0W9517X92-w)
* [Another video tutorial](https://youtu.be/5yEDYizAS-U)

Also, don't hesistate to ask for help on the Discord.

While the current system is fully functional, it has some limitations, and we'll continue to explore this area in the future and see if we can bring even more flexible ways to control the flow of your trains.

### Mass replacing of vehicles is a hassle

We'll introduce mass replacing of vehicles in one of the next updates.

### Cities build impossible to connect roads

This will be worked on after the track system rework described earlier.

### Is the current gameplay loop final?

Not even close! We have plans for a lot of new gameplay mechanics that will greatly diversify the gameplay. Please check [our roadmap](/roadmap).

### My trucks get loaded with cargo that is not meant for them!

By default, trucks (or railcars) get loaded with any available cargo they can handle. However, you can force them to load only specific cargo by doing one of these:
* When buying a vehicle, click the magic wand icon above the truck or railcar and choose a specific cargo
* Send the vehicle to a depot, open the depot window, and click on the small cog icon on the bottom right corner of the vehicle card to reconfigure the vehicle. Then you'll be able to choose a specific cargo by clicking the magic wand icon as described above

You can also add refit tasks to a vehicle's schedule to reconfigure it for different cargo on different stations.

With the next update, we'll introduce the next changes to help newcomers:
* Storage will be not chosen by default, you'll have to choose either Auto or exact cargo type explicitly (as it already working with storages)
* You'll be able to manually refit a vehicle by clicking on the cargo icon in the Details tab of the Vehicle window, without the need to send a vehicle to a depot

### Will passengers able to switch stations in the future?

Absolutely! The current implementation is just a beginning.

### Will passengers travel to factories?

Yes, we have plans for that.

### Can I set a schedule that way that my bus traverse stations like 1-2-3-2-1, without the need to add all five stops?

Sure! Go to edit schedule mode, then click on the icon on the left of the route name.

### Are there any more hidden features related to setting up a schedule?

Check these posts:
* [A new way to set up a schedule](https://voxeltycoon.xyz/devlog/vehicle-window-facelift/)
* [Passengers](https://voxeltycoon.xyz/devlog/passengers/)

### Where is creative mode?

There's no separate creative mode at the moment, but you can use some cheats if you just want to play with all available stuff right now, ignoring game rules.

To activate cheats, press `Ctrl+Alt+C` while in-game (not the main menu). The game will ask you if you really want to do that.

After cheats are activated, there are some secret menus now available here and there, for example:
* Right-click on the money indicator at the bottom left corner and set any amount of money you need
* Right-click on the research button at the bottom right corner to unlock all research
* Right-click on the research name on the left of the research tree window to unlock any specific research
* Right-click on the button at the bottom of the warehouse window to fill the storage with selected items
* Right-click on the vehicle unit card in the Details tab of the Vehicle window to fill the unit with selected items

We plan to add the proper creative mode in future updates.

### When the multiplayer is coming?

No timeframe at this point, this is a pretty major task that is at its early stages currently. We'd say don't expect it arrives this year. If you're looking exclusively for a multiplayer experience, we advise you to hold your purchase until it will be implemented.

## That's it for now

If you have any more questions, feel free to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/voxeltycoon) and ask them there!

Hello fellow tycoons! If you wonder how things are going on with the development of the game right now, this post is for you.

The next big feature we are working on is the [rework of rail and road systems](https://voxeltycoon.xyz/devlog/ea-faq#i-have-hard-times-building-bridges-connecting-roads-etc). It is a huge task and its results won't be available to testers for a few more updates. Please be patient on that, we want to make everything right this time so we don't need to remake it for the 5th time 😉

Of course, it would be too long time to wait before this update will be released. So, we continue to work on other updates and plan to release them on regular basis. For example, the next update adds - and many of you already guessed it - the highly requested vehicle auto-replacement functionality.

However, those of you who follow the development closely (like our [beta testers](/beta)) might have noticed that the update pace has slowed down a bit. Some of you might even think that the game is abandoned… but not so fast!

We just took a little summer vacation after 5 years of work on the game. This mostly involved not laying on the beach but finally completing some overdue personal business.

Remember [this incident](/devlog/development-update/)? The time has come to remove the plate from Andrew's shoulder, and now it's done! It had to be removed earlier, but we couldn’t just take our dedication from the Early Access release.

Another thing we did is moving to other cities. It was planned some time ago and it finally happened. It's still two different cities, so we continue to work remotely.

Now, as we finished these real-life things, we are ready to get back to work. The pace of updates will speed up soon. Also, we are looking for a possibility of expanding our team with more developers to speed up the development even further. Can’t share anything on that at the moment, but hopefully, everything will work out.

What we know for sure is that we are not going anywhere, and the future of Voxel Tycoon is bright. At the moment of writing, the game has 85% of positive reviews on [Steam](/buy). We can't stop thank you people for such a warm welcome of Voxel Tycoon. It means a lot to us 💜

And it's worth mentioning that by no means do we think Voxel Tycoon is close to being done. There's a [ton of work ahead](/roadmap), and we absolutely inspired to make these plans a reality, together with you!

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/halloween-2021/halloween-2021.mp4" alt="Spooky sneak peek of what's coming in the next update"  %}

We are aware that many of you wonder if the next update is still in the works. And it is!

We don't have the date for it yet, but it should not take too long at this point. The update will be focused on the mass vehicle replacement, and this feature already took more time than it was originally expected - that's why we avoid giving any dates until we are completely sure we can meet them.

Partially, the delay is caused by our work in direction of expanding our team. This process is not easy (who would have thought!), and it grabs some of our resources from the development. Essentially, the current update is longer in development because we want to make a foundation for quicker development of future updates.

Anyways, the update will hit the [beta branch](/beta) soon, and you can actually see part of its functionality in the video above.

And of course, it's the perfect time to resurrect the **FREE** official Voxel Tycoon spin-off called [Railroad to Hell 3](/railroad-to-hell). Take a death ride and share your top scores!

title: 'Mass vehicle replacement, no more teleportation to depots, saves cloud sync, and more!'
thumb: /assets/posts/update-87/thumb.png
thumb_square: /assets/posts/update-87/thumb_square.png
---

Update 0.87 is finally here! Read below for a detailed introduction into what's new, or hop directly into the [full changelog](/changelog#0.87).

## Mass vehicle replacement

One of the major headaches of our tycoons finally gets its treatment.

Usually, once you research a new truck, locomotive, or rail car you want to replace your old slow and ineffective ones with it. Previously, to do so, you needed manually locate every single vehicle which could be upgraded, send it to a depot - by manually picking it - and then manually reconfigure it (or sell and buy a new one, but don't forget to assign the correct routes!)

Luckily, there's a new feature that will save you a few <s>thousand</s> clicks.

### Introducing mass vehicle replacement

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-87/3.png" %}

And it's not just about *replacement* - you can mass *reconfigure* your vehicles, replacing exact railcars, or even changing what cargo they should transport.

Just choose what kind of vehicles should be affected, and specify how the result should look like. The game will do the rest for you: it will find a vehicle for replacement, send it to the nearest suitable depot, replace/reconfigure it, and then release it back to the route.

To avoid putting too much stress on your budget, you can set the required minimum amount of money on your balance before a vehicle will be sent for replace.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-87/4.png" alt="You can fine-tune the replacement process by specifying exact routes on what vehicles should be replaced." %}

Vehicles are sent for replace one by one to avoid clogging ways to depots, and to prevent  a substantial drop in supply rates.

### Future plans

While the current implementation should be a relief, we have more ideas on how we can make the process even more flawless. It works exactly like any other feature in VT - they're still a work in progress, and we plan to constantly work on improving every aspect of the game, together with you!

## No more teleportation (almost)

Speaking of sending vehicles to depots - before today, when you send a vehicle to a depot, it just stopped, then started reporting as going to a depot, and then - *poof!* - it just disappears, then magically shows in the depot. Implementing the mass vehicle replacement seemed like the perfect time to make vehicles properly go to depots (since we need to touch this part anyways) like it was always intended.

Now, when you hit the Send to depot button from the Vehicle window or the Fleet window, you will be prompted with these options:

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-87/20211218-214726.png" style="inline-right" %}

* <b>Send to the nearest depot</b> - the game will pick the nearest depot which could serve the vehicle for you.
* <b>Send to the selected depot</b> - you can manually select the depot where you want the vehicle to arrive.
* <b>Tow to the selected depot</b> - if case the vehicle is really stuck and doesn't have a clear path to any depot, you still can ask <i>to tow</i> the vehicle to the depot of your choice. It essentially behaves almost like it was previously - teleporting the vehicle to the depot, but now it costs you money, so consider this as a last resort option.

## Saves cloud sync

Now, you can continue playing your favorite worlds on another computer from where you left it, thanks to [Steam Cloud](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/68D2-35AB-09A9-7678) support.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-87/20211220-215718.png" %}

To enable cloud sync for exact save, open the Load Game window (or Save Game window) and then click the cloud icon in the upper left corner of the saved game card. This save will become available on any computer where you've logged in with your Steam account.

## Progression balance

Many of you have reported that cities grow too fast, and you quickly start to feel overwhelmed with business' demands. We are aware of this, and actually, we have several features planned that should deepen gameplay and at the same time address this issue.

While they are in the works, with this update we've reduced cities' growth speed by 25% as a temporary solution, so it should feel a bit more relaxed.

## Other improvements

### New status icons in the Fleet window

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-87/2.png" %}

Now you can clearly differentiate when a vehicle is scheduled for replace, going to a depot, or already inside a depot.

### Space for pause

It's pretty common for tycoon games that hitting <kbd>Space</kbd> toggles pause. For some reason, that was not the case for Voxel Tycoon, but now it's fixed.

For new installs pausing the game will be set to <kbd>Space</kbd> by default. For existing players, current key bindings will be preserved. If you want to use <kbd>Space</kbd> for pause, reset key bindings at `Settings → Controls`.

### Multi-select rows with Shift

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/update-87/video2.mp4" %}

You can now quickly select many items in checkbox lists by dragging through items or by clicking while holding <kbd>Shift</kbd>.

### Separate horn volume

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-87/1.png" %}

The volume of vehicle horns now can be configured separately the from overall volume, if you find them too intruding.

### Analytics data management

To detect problems with the game performance early, we collect some anonymous data using services provided by Unity.

We know that for some of you it's important to understand what information the analytics service collects, so we made it accessible with ease. You can now open your personal data management page (`Game → Data collection settings`) and see what data are collected, or even completely opt-out from Unity’s data collection.

## Modding

### World generation mods

It was already possible for mods to override how worlds are generated. It was demonstrated by the amazing [Biome-izer](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2617844263) mod, which not only richens your worlds with spectacular rivers, mesas, and other features but also provides a lot of new settings for biome assets for those modders who prefer to stay away from script mods (we can't blame you for that!).

However, making it possible was pretty hacky and prone to be broken with new updates. Now, the game provides `WorldGeneratorManager` which allows a modder to easily swap the vanilla worldgen with their own custom `IWorldGenerator` implementations.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-87/5.png" src2="/assets/posts/update-87/6.png" src3="/assets/posts/update-87/7.png" %}

### Global mods

Some mods would greatly benefit or even would be impossible to exist without the ability to work in the main menu (before the world is created). We are working in that direction, and hopefully will be able to make it real soon.

### Workshop filtering

With the number of mods increasing over time (thank you, dear modders!) it becomes pretty hard to navigate through the Workshop looking for a new mod to try. To help players with that, Workshop items could have tags (like *Vehicles*, *Buildings*, *Worldgen*, etc) to filter by them.

Currently, there's no way to specify a tag when uploading a mod, but we plan to add support for it with the next minor update.

## What's next

Now, as we have a way to automatically send vehicles to depots, and players can effortlessly replace them when needed, it feels natural to start introducing vehicles' wear and obsolescence. We expect to introduce these concepts with one of the next updates.

In parallel, we continue to iterate on the monumental rails and roads rework. We are absolutely aware that the current implementation - while obviously working in most cases - is a source of great frustration for players.

The new system not only should make building a much more pleasant experience, but introduce many new interesting features, like so:

* Level crossings
* Customizable curvature of tracks
* Left-hand traffic
* Diagonal roads
* One-way roads
* Horizontally curved bridges and tunnels
* Planning mode
* Support for blueprints/templates
* Performance optimizations

We have no estimate to share at this point but expect to hear about it more often with future updates.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-87/1.jpg" %}

## That's it for today!

We want to remind you that we are still in the Early Access stage. All the new features above are not something set in stone and are subject to change and improvement as the game is getting further developed.

Your feedback is very important in this process, and we highly encourage you to share any thoughts with us and the community on our [Discord](http://discord.gg/voxeltycoon), [discussion board](/suggestions).

Happy Holidays, and see you next year! 🎁

title: Development update
thumb: /assets/posts/2022-spring-development-update/1.png
---

*Starting from now, we'll go back to writing regular posts on what's going on with the Voxel Tycoon development. We hope this will make the development process more transparent for you. Thank you!*

At the moment, we are working on several things that will find their way to Voxel Tycoon over the next several updates.

## Vehicle wear and obsolescence

With the previous major update, we've introduced mass vehicle replacement. That feature finally prepared the grounds for something we wanted to add for some time already: the aging of vehicles.

Vehicles will wear over time depending on their usage. As they become more old, they will start require more often maintenances, resulting in increasing costs and idling times.

Besides that, vehicle obsolescence will be introduced. When you progress through the game and unlock newer vehicles, using older ones will become more disadvantageous than it is now. We'll talk about how it will work closer to the release of that feature.
Of course, both wear and obsolescence could be turned off in gameplay settings for more relaxed gameplay.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/2022-spring-development-update/2.png" %}

## Demands rework

Another thing that requires some attention is how demands work. Demands are part of the core mechanic of the game, and it's pretty important to have them entertaining: not shallow, but not too complex at the same time.

Demands already have several mechanics: their economy is based on the demand/supply balance, they grow if you supply them well, or degrade if you don't. Also, they go bankrupt if you don't supply them at all for some time.

The last bit became a source of frustration for players. Initially, the idea was that saving a business from bankruptcy will serve as a motivation to extend your transport network. However, players quickly get overwhelmed with a lot of businesses here and there, all demanding to be saved.

A bankruptcy of a business currently has no direct effect on your company and it's actually often expected: for example, you have no access to required resource yet and plan to gain it later. Still, it gives players feeling of failing to keep up with the game.

To improve this situation, we are working on something we call *Contracts*. With contracts, you are not obligated to deliver everything everywhere by default. Instead, you explicitly decide if you want to supply a specific business. By signing a contract with a business you're committing to satisfying its needs long-term. This way, you may no longer care about other businesses until you are actually ready to supply them.

Another related change is that now you're in control of when to upgrade your contract to the next level of demand, so you can do it only when you're sure you want to increase goods flow.

On another side, violating a contract — ie. not supplying a business for a long time — will result in a penalty. We'll talk about it in one of the next posts.

Also, with this rework (or shortly after) we want to introduce a window where you'll be able to see all your demands and corresponding information at a glance.

## Addressing community issues

While many of you love the game in its current state — thank you 💜! — we hear those voices who expected to get more in a shorter periods of time.

We keep working to make the rate of updates more frequent and consistent. Our team consists of just 2 guys, and right now we are in the process of hiring more people. This has a delayed effect since new members need some time to get comfortable with the development flow. We'll make everything possible to speed up this process.

Another major issue is the lack of new information from us between updates, resulting in the feeling that the game has gone dead. First, we want to assure you, that Voxel Tycoon by no means is going to become abandoned. This game is the project of our lives. We have a big [roadmap](https://voxeltycoon.xyz/roadmap) that reflects what we want to see in the finished game.

As mentioned in the intro to this post, we'll do regular posts on the current state of things from now on, to make the development clear and transparent for you, our beloved players.

Oh, and one more thing that bothers many of you: when the level crossings will appear in the game. We are working on it! As we mentioned in previous posts, level crossings depends on the [rails and roads rework](https://voxeltycoon.xyz/devlog/mass-vehicle-replacement/#whats-next) which is currently in active development in parallel with the features described above.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/2022-spring-development-update/1.png" %}

That being said, this is our first game, and it's pretty complex in both technical and management ways. We are constantly learning the better approaches on how to handle all the things. There's a lot to do, and we are committed to making it real. Thanks for taking this journey together with us! Please [Join our Discord](//discord.gg/VoxelTycoon) and share your thoughts.

It's been a whole year already since the Voxel Tycoon arrived to the Steam Early Access.

Wow!

We remember that mix of excitement and fear boiling inside our souls on the day when we hit the **Release** button like it was yesterday. And we are not sure what of those feelings were prevailing at that moment!

Fortunately, you liked what we've created. You gave us amazing reviews, bringing the Voxel Tycoon to the *Very Positive* overall review level. You wrote a ton of helpful feedback on our [bug](/bugs) and [suggestion](/suggestions) trackers. You made guides and videos [to help](//discord.gg/VoxelTycoon) other players. You created [lots of creative mods](https://steamcommunity.com/app/732050/workshop/), expanding the game with new content and gameplay. You helped to make the Voxel Tycoon what it is today.

Thank you very much for that 💜

However, our ride is far from over. There're [a lot of things](/roadmap) yet to be done on the way to the full release (aka 1.0). And we hope you will find it joyful to experience this adventure together with us.

## The first year in numbers

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/ea-first-year-recap/2.png" alt="Not bad, but not enough. We want to do more in the Year 2." %}

## What's next

The second year of the Voxel Tycoon Early Access promises to be more feature-rich and productive. Hopefully, over time we gain a better understanding of how to properly manage the development process. The hustle and bustle of the release have settled down, and now we can speed up our work without compromising quality.

In the coming months, you can expect the release of features that were discussed in [the previous post](/devlog/2022-spring-development-update): the demands rework (aka Contracts) and the vehicle obsolesence. And later this year we expect to introduce the long-awaited rails and roads rework, including level crossings. Of course, this is not everything that we've prepared for you in the Year 2, so stay tuned!

Just in case you wonder, the next update is just around the corner. 

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/2022-august-development-update/1.png" alt="Progress on the update so far" %}

Actually, the main issue that is blocking its release is an annoying bug in the version of Unity engine we are currently using. This bug completely breaks UI and there's no easy workaround known, so we have to wait until Unity guys fix it. 

Good news are that they are aware of this issue and already working on a fix. We expected it to land during next two weeks.

Just as the fixed version of the engine become available, we'll be able to push the next update to the beta branch. Of course, we will let you know about it with a separate announcement. Stay tuned!

The [0.87.2 update](/changelog#0.87.2) has just landed! It brings plenty of quality-of-life improvements and fixes to the table.

But before we will dive into what's inside, please welcome our new full-time team member: **@DarkMajesty** 🎉

He joined us just two months ago and actually made this update real! While we continue working on long-term tasks like Rails and Roads Rework (also known as RRR) and Contracts Update, we finally have someone who can back us up and help to fill the void between those major milestones.

Alright, now let's get back to business!

## Gameplay changes

### Devices now have predefined input and output directions

Device inputs and output directions are now predefined and can't be changed. This should help new players, as well as raise some challenges to experience players when planning their setups. Let us know what you think!

### Get creative!

We are still getting amazed by the creative ways you use decorations to build your beautiful worlds. To free your creativity even further, this update unlocks new degrees of freedom when placing your decorations.

The rotation is no longer fixed to 90° angles.

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/update-87-2/1.mp4" %}

You can now scale decorations both up and down.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-87-2/1.png" %}

To help you properly align your creations, you can now change the world grid step in settings (10 by default):

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-87-2/2.png" alt="Grid step set to 3" %}

### City rename price

Many of you complained that option to rename cities was a bit pricy. We wanted to make renaming a city an achievement, but it become clear that many of you just want to name a city, not a big deal after all!

Also, our algorithm for deciding the price goes a bit crazy over time:

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-87-2/4.png" alt="The exact amount of 'game dead' comments we receive every day" %}

So, prices were greatly reduced and made more predictable. But don’t get too comfortable: one of the future updates will bring a company rating, and we plan to tie the ability to rename cities to the level of approval of your company in that exact settlement.

### Mixed trains

The game now properly supports trains consisting of both electric and steam/diesel engines. Before, such trains could not pass the non-electrified part of the tracks.

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/update-87-2/4.mp4" %}

## Builder palette rework

When you play with many mods, navigating the builder palette quickly become a complicated task. This is especially true for decorations:

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/update-87-2/8.mp4" %}

To help you with that, we've completely reworked the builder palette.

Now, buildings are split into categories, which you can navigate on the left of the window.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-87-2/13.png" %}

Modders can use built-in categories or create their own.

Buildings now can be sorted: alphabetically, by price, or by size.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-87-2/16.png" %}

Or you can choose to display buildings only from specific mods.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-87-2/15.png" %}

The new compact view option allows fitting the maximum amount of buildings into view for a quick glance.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-87-2/12.png" %}

The palette also now features text search.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-87-2/14.png" %}

All of these features are available not only for decorations but for any type of building.

And the last thing: to help you keep track of where you've left the window now opens already scrolled to the last built object.

## Conveyor improvements

In this update, we've addressed the issue with misdirected conveyors. It was easy to mess it up and make conveyors face each other, blocking the flow of items. It was especially annoying when this happened just inside device inputs and outputs, because it's really hard to stop, making players scratch their heads over why items not going in or out of the device.

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/update-87-2/7.mp4" %}

We've addressed this in two ways.

First, we've greatly improved the direction auto-detection algorithm which decides in which direction the conveyor belt should move after build.

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/update-87-2/6.mp4" %}

Second, we've added the easy-to-spot indicator that will pop up in the exact place of misdirection. Even more, just click on it and directions will be fixed automatically.

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/update-87-2/5.mp4" %}

These changes should greatly reduce the amount of confusion and tedious work manually switching conveyor directions.

Another improvement allows you to build devices closer to each other without the need to demolish conveyors.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-87-2/8.png" %}

## Other QoL updates

### Search and toggle all mods when creating a new game

Sometimes you want to play a different set of mods or create a vanilla game with no mods at all. It’s already possible by toggling individual mods in the New game window.

However, if you have a really big amount of mods installed, toggling mods back and forth starts to be cumbersome. So we updated the Mods tab with a search bar and Toggle all options.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-87-2/18.png" %}

### Configure displayed budget totals

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-87-2/3.png" %}

One-time money spending like laying out a long railroad or building a factory may affect the understanding of your current month-to-month balance. Now you can tune the total display for your needs by choosing what exact budget items should count in total numbers.

### Distance to nearby signals

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-87-2/6.png" %}

When placing signals, there's a new option that will allow you to enable displaying a distance to the closest signal or intersection. Along with the already existing auto-placing feature, this should help to distribute your signals as desired.

### Non-electrified parts highlight

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-87-2/7.png" %}

When using the electrification tool, non-electrified parts of the track will be highlighted in red. No more trains stuck because of 1 tile missing wires!

### Fleet window

Besides the ability to mass send vehicles to depots and mass assign vehicles to a route, there’s a new action to mass-release vehicles from depots.

To accommodate more actions added, we’ve redesigned the actions area - and not only in a visual way. Now send and release actions behave as toggles and can be canceled if required.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-87-2/19.png" %}

Also, we've fixed how vehicles are sorted by their names. Now it should look like a human would expect.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-87-2/5.png" %}

This also applies to route names.

### Mass replacement

Replacements now can be paused - each separately, or all at once, for more precise control over your spendings.

Also, replacements now will preserve the vehicle’s cargo where possible, and we’ve fixed annoying notifications spam happening when a vehicle can’t find a depot for replacement.

### Error handling

Previously, if a mod breaks the game while it loads to the main menu, the game will just be stuck forever, until you unsubscribe from the problematic mod. And you are left to wonder which of your 100 mods collection is the bad one.

Now the game will detect such problems, and then show you a detailed dialog, letting you know what was happen, and suggesting actions based on context.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-87-2/9.png" %}

For example, it will allow you to just disable the problematic mod and restart the game, or go to the Workshop page to let the mod author know that there's a problem.

By the way, the in-game bug icon got a promotion! Now, if an unexpected error will occur during play, the red banner will be displayed. Click on it will open a new developer console.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-87-2/11.png" %}

Yes, the game now has a developer console, which could be toggled at any point with <kbd>Ctrl + `</kbd>. It displays game logs in real-time and also will accept user commands in the future.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-87-2/10.png" %}

You can also disable the bug banner reappearing from there for the current play session.

## Modding updates

### Categories

There's a new `.categories` asset that is used to organize buildings in the builder palette. Feel free to assign built-in categories to your assets, or even add your own categories. Also, let us know if you think some new categories should be added to the base game.

### Important device asset change

The direction of device inputs and outputs now should be explicitly set in assets. Please update your mods or they won’t work as expected.

### Load only needed assets in Asset Editor 

You can now choose what pack to load in Asset Editor to significantly improve load times.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-87-2/17.png" %}

### Decorations animation support

`.decoration` assets now can be animated in the same manner as devices or mines.

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/update-87-2/2.mp4" %}

### Spotlight direction

Previously, buildings technically could have not only point lights, but also spotlights. However, there was no way to set the direction where a spotlight is pointed, which made them pretty useless. Now, this is fixed.

### Cars smoke support

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/update-87-2/3.mp4" %}

Joining trains, road vehicles can emit smoke now.

## Wrapping up

This update is the minor one, but it brings a lot of useful improvements and fixes. We've covered the most important changes here, and if you want more, [check the full changelog](/changelog#0.87.2) for this update.

In the meantime, we keep working on new gameplay features, and we hope to present them to all of you soon. Thank you and see you next time!

thumb: /assets/posts/update-87-3/thumb.png
thumb_square: /assets/posts/update-87-3/thumb_square.png
---

> This is an intermediate update mostly focused on modding improvements, but also has some fixes inside. Check the [full changelog](/changelog#0.87.3) if you are really curious.

## Support for devices with multiple outputs

The recent [lock of device inputs/output directions](/devlog/update-87-2/#devices-now-have-predefined-input-and-output-directions) made possible the new feature that was requested by modders for quite some time already. This update introduces support for devices capable of producing more than one product. Even more, products now can have different probabilities of yield.

For example, it is now possible to create a device that will process raw coal and output charcoal every time, but also - with a very small probability - it can output a shiny pricey diamond.

Or, there could be a uranium ore processing device that will yield the regular uranium 99.99% of the time, but also there's a 0.01% chance of outputting some rare isotope. 

The main intended usage of this feature is devices yielding byproducts, but we are sure that our awesome community will find many creative ways to (ab)use it!

### UI changes

To accommodate the new feature we had to redesign how product recipes are displayed in the device and recipe picker windows.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-87-3/2.png" %}

The new design allows displaying more than one output product, output probabilities, as well as exact inputs and outputs assignments.

There're also new device indicators that show input and output directions and locations in the world, as well as the items expected to come in and out.

And they are not just here to inform, they are also interactive: clicking on it allows you to configure item assignments.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-87-3/3.png" %}

## Languages, city and people names, and currencies modding support 

Our intention was always to make Voxel Tycoon as moddable as possible. But not every type of asset easily supports this.

For example, the currently selected language is loaded just as the game starts. If this language comes from a mod and the player decided to unsubscribe from this mod, from the game perspective an asset required to even show the main menu is just missing, and the game won't be able to start. The same applies to currencies and city names assets, since they are also used in the main menu. 

Thanks to the new [error handling system](/devlog/update-87-2#error-handling), the game is now able to gracefully handle such situations. So, we've implemented the missing parts and now the modding of languages, currencies, and city and people names is finally possible.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-87-3/4.png" alt="It's time to reticulate some splines for some serious §§§" %}

## A few fixes 

### Items no longer got vaporized inside devices between sessions

In the process of reworking the device window, we have also touched the devices' internals a bit. Besides other changes intended to streamline devices' logic flow, we have fixed the issue that was in the game from the very beginning: previously, items inside devices were not saved between sessions, and effectively they just got vaporized when you load your game. While it wasn't such a big problem in most cases, it's always better to know that your hard-earned products are safe now.

### Double conveyor fix

Continuing [efforts on improving conveyor building](/devlog/update-87-2#conveyor-improvements), we got the bug squashed where the conveyor builder tool was placing double overlapping conveyor pieces in some cases. These double pieces produced weird issues where items can’t pass through otherwise looking alright conveyor junctions.

## That's it for now

This is probably the last minor update for the 0.87 version. Stay tuned for what's coming next!

title: "Passengers 2.0 Update"
thumb: /assets/posts/update-88/thumb.png
thumb_square: /assets/posts/update-88/thumb_square.png
---

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-88/thumb.png" %}

Today’s [update](/changelog) brings you smarter passengers, mail, GeForce NOW support, and other improvements. Plus, we are happy to announce that we are taking part in the Steam Event, first ever in our history!

## Smarter passengers

Passengers were introduced with the Early Access release, and their behavior since then has been pretty simple: they waiting for a bus or train to take them directly to their destination. They don’t want to switch stations, not to mention transport modes (e.g. from bus to train or vice versa).

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-88/8.png" %}

With this update, passengers are much more smart — they are now aware of concept of switching stations, and even transport modes. And they can do it more than once! Passengers can take a bus, then switch it to a train, then switch again to another bus in order to get where they need. This should unlock you a new level of flexibility when planning your routes.

## New kind of freight: Mail

First time since the Steam Early Access release, we’re introducing a new kind of cargo to deliver: mail! Collect it at passenger stations to deliver it to recipients, using intermediate stations to transfer between modes of transport.

## Passenger UI improvements

To let you better understand what’s going on with passengers and mail on your transport network, we’ve made several improvements to UI.

First, we’ve updated the passenger and mail popups to be more readable and compact. It now groups passengers by destination, and also highlights unreachable directions, for example, due to lack of transport on a route.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-88/6.png" %}

Second, passenger stations now have new labels indicating amount of passenger and mail awaiting on this station.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-88/7.png" %}

Last but not least, current passenger coverage is now shown when placing passenger stations. This makes it easier to distribute them and achieve 100% coverage more efficiently.

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/update-88/6.mp4" %}

There is always room for improvement, so we will continue to work on both the gameplay and user interface aspects of passengers and mail in future updates.

## Base Builder Fest

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-88/2.png" %}

We’re thrilled to announce that we’ll be taking part in the **Base Builder Fest**, starting on January 23! This is the first Steam Event for us and we are really looking forward to see how it will go.

Also, we understand that some of you who don't have the game yet were affected by the recent regional price changes. During the Fest, you (or your friends) will have a great opportunity to get the game for a lower price.

Oh, and by the way, if you like our game and haven’t wrote a review yet: please do that! It helps a lot 💫

## GeForce NOW

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-88/1.png" %}

We are happy to announce that Voxel Tycoon will be available to stream through [GeForce NOW](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/) in a few months. Play anywhere from almost any device: GeForce NOW instantly transforms your laptop, desktop, Mac, TV, Android device, iPhone, or iPad into the powerful PC gaming rig you’ve always dreamed of.

One important thing though: to get your saves available on GFN, you should have them in the Cloud.

To make this process a bit easier, we’ve added a new toggle to the save dialog, allowing you explicitly put the new save to Cloud. 

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-88/3.png" %}

Of course, you can always toggle Cloud sync from the list of saved games by clicking the cloud icon.

## Other improvements

### Add buildings to favorites

Building upon the work made in the [Minor Update](https://www.notion.so/Passengers-2-0-Update-d836e3e218cc45228ee53e5734069277), we continue to make building palette more easy to use when you have a lot buildings from mods. This time, we’ve added Favorites functionality. Buildings added to favorites will be always displayed on top.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-88/4.png" %}

### Better trailers behavior

We’ve improved the visual appearance of trucks with trailers in tight turns. This should be especially noticeable on road-trains, such is the

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/update-88/2.mp4" %}

### Software cursor

The game always used the so-called *hardware* cursor (rendered by the OS, not the game). It rendered independently of the game and doesn’t get affected by the game performance — so it always moves fluidly even in case of FPS drops.

However, it doesn't respect the game's UI scale (only the OS scale). In [some cases](https://github.com/voxeltycoon/issues/issues/1000) this might be a problem. As a workaround for such situations, we've added support for *software* cursor (rendered by the game). It might be least responsive at times, but it scales with the UI properly. You can toggle it in *Settings → General → Use software cursor*.

## Expand the base game with mods

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-88/5.png" %}

A friendly reminder: there’re [over 200 mods](https://steamcommunity.com/app/732050/workshop/) waiting for you in the Workshop, made by talented and creative members of our amazing community. You will find dozens of new trains, cars, buildings, entire supply chains, and even game mechanics which will give you a new perspective on the Voxel Tycoon experience. Give it a try!

## What’s next

We continue our work on the rails and roads rework (also known as *RRR*) which will bring rail crossings, better tools for laying roads and rails, and many other related improvements. We don’t have the timeframe to share yet, but we steadily moving towards it.

Meanwhile, the next updates will bring some interesting features, such as vehicle obsolescence and Contracts mechanics, which will add some new twists to the game.

Thanks for reading, and see you next time, folks 💜

title: "Custom Rules Update: infinite money and resources, vehicle color schemes, and more!"
thumb: /assets/posts/update-88-4/thumb.png
thumb_square: /assets/posts/update-88-4/thumb_square.png
---

This intermediate update introduced color scheme support for vehicles, new Custom Rules to tailor your gameplay experience, and a few improvements and enhancements for both players and modders. If you want to delve into the details, you can check out the [full changelog](/changelog#0.88.4), or embark on a journey with us through this post for an engaging introduction.

## Color schemes for vehicles

We're introducing a subtle, yet handy new feature in Voxel Tycoon: color schemes for vehicles. This addition allows for a touch more personalization in your fleet.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-88-4/8.png" %}

From now on, vehicles in Voxel Tycoon can flaunt more than just a single color scheme. When you're about to purchase a vehicle which has alternative color schemes, a new picker will pop up on the vehicle card.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-88-4/2.png" %}

This allows you to select your preferred color scheme right before purchase, adding an extra layer of personalization and differentiation to your fleet. This added touch of customization is yet another step towards making your transportation empire truly unique.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-88-4/6.png" %}

We acknowledge that many mods in the past featured different color schemes for a single vehicle, but they were constrained to present them as separate vehicles. Now, those color schemes can be merged, simplifying the modding process and providing a better overall experience for players.

To further enhance the customization of your fleet, we've added company-specific color schemes for passenger buses and wagons. This allows you to unify your fleet with your company colors, contributing to a more cohesive visual identity for your transportation empire.

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/update-88-4/3.mp4" %}

These new color schemes are designed to enhance your gameplay experience, providing more customization options and adding more flavor to your fleet. We can't wait to see the vibrant and diverse fleets you will create!

Oh, and our passenger rail cars will now light up beautifully at night!

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-88-4/3.png" %}

## New mail rail cars

To augment the transportation of mail, we've added brand new Tier 1 and Tier 2 mail rail cars.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-88-4/4.png" %}

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-88-4/5.png" %}

Please note that box cars are no longer suitable for mail.

## Introducing Custom Rules

Have you ever wondered what it would be like to play with resource deposits that never deplete? We know you have, given that the Infinite Resources mod (which we created simply as a modding example) has become the most subscribed mod of all time.

Many players have also expressed interest in a Creative Mode. While we wanted to cater to these requests, it was essential for us to maintain the core essence of the original game. To strike this balance, we are introducing **Custom Rules**. This new feature provides a streamlined, in-game integrated method for personalizing your gaming experience.

With Custom Rules, you can enable specific experiences to play the game your way. At present, the Custom Rules include game-changing options such as **Infinite Resources**, **Unlimited Money**, and **Everlasting Demands**. These modes let you bypass some of the typical constraints of the game, allowing for a unique, personalized gameplay experience. Settings like **Allow turn around**, **All research completed**, and **Start with semaphores** added to the roster of Custom Rules as well.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/update-88-4/7.png" %}

Enabled rules will be shown on the Win/Lose screen, so you'll always know what parameters were in play. We've also added a **Custom Rules** badge to the save slot cards, allowing you to view the rules active for each game, ensuring full transparency and control over your gaming experience.

Furthermore, mods now have the ability to introduce their own Custom Rules as well. This enables mod creators to further enhance and customize the gameplay experience for their users. You can find an example of how to add your own Custom Rules in a mod [here](https://github.com/voxeltycoon/mods/tree/master/CustomRulesExampleMod).

## 0.88.1-0.88.4 minor features recap

Recognizing that not everyone sifts through every detail in our changelogs, we wanted to recap some of the most interesting changes we've rolled out in past minor updates. Each of these changes plays a part in our continued efforts to ensure an enjoyable and hassle-free gaming experience for all our players. We appreciate your feedback and are committed to making Voxel Tycoon the best it can be.

### More room for creativity

We've expanded the character limit for names across the game. Now, you can have longer names for everything that can be renamed, including your company, cities, vehicles, stations, depots, labs, route names, and even save names. This gives you more room to express your creativity and individuality in your gaming world.

### Non-QWERTY keyboard layouts

In a bid to make Voxel Tycoon more accessible, we've enhanced support for non-QWERTY keyboard layouts. This improvement ensures that the game's user interface will now correctly display the hotkeys corresponding to your keyboard layout, such as A instead of Q on AZERTY.

We've also added the option to choose from pre-defined QWERTY and AZERTY layouts in the controls settings.

### Accessibility

In our commitment to enhancing game accessibility, we introduced a feature in the 0.88.2 update that allows you to reduce the contrast in build mode. This feature aims to ensure a comfortable visual experience for all players.

Additionally, we've made it so tooltips no longer disappear when taking a screenshot with Print Screen.

We've also added a `Copy many vehicles at once with SHIFT` hint to the tooltip for the Copy Vehicle button. We recognize there are many hidden places where the SHIFT key can be used, so we are aiming to expose those functions more clearly through our UI.

### Better error handling 

In order to provide a smoother experience when dealing with script mod errors, we've replaced the generic `Failed to load .dll` message box with a more detailed error window. This window offers useful actions such as 'Disable and Reload', and 'Go to Workshop'. When encountering a failed patching, the error message is now much clearer and specifies the problematic patch. We've also enhanced how the game handles missing assets cases, now reporting asset Uri over numerical id.

### Improved performance on Mac M1/M2

Lastly, update 0.88.3 brought about improvements specifically for players on M1/M2 machines where we've introduced a potential fix for memory leaks, hangs, and crashes. The issues seem to have been completely resolved for now.

## Looking forward

We understand that our pace of development may appear slow to some, but rest assured, this is our deliberate approach to ensure we uphold our vision and maintain the high quality that Voxel Tycoon demands. All of the announced features, including Rails and Roads Rework, Contracts, and vehicle obsolescence, are indeed in active development. We prefer to take our time to polish and perfect these features rather than rushing them.

We want to keep you informed and involved every step of the way. That's why we continually update our [roadmap](/roadmap), which provides a clear outline of what to expect in the future of Voxel Tycoon.

We highly value your thoughts and feedback on these new updates, and we would love to hear about your experiences as you dive into them. Please join us in our [Discord community](http://discord.gg/voxeltycoon) where you can share your ideas, ask questions, discuss strategies, and connect with fellow gamers. It's the perfect place to learn more about Voxel Tycoon and contribute to our vibrant community.

Your feedback and support are invaluable to us. You are an integral part of our development process, and your patience and understanding are what enable us to craft Voxel Tycoon into the game we all envision.

So, stay tuned for more updates and improvements. And as always, thank you for being with us on this exciting adventure. See you next time 💜

title: "Better bulldozing and late-game performance improvements"
thumb: /assets/posts/update-88-5/thumb.png
thumb_square: /assets/posts/update-88-5/thumb_square.png
---

Today’s [update](/changelog#0.88.5) is twofold: refining the bulldozing process for a smoother workflow and significantly boosting late-game performance. We’re keen for you to delve into these enhancements and share your experiences!

## Bulldozing Enhancements

We're excited to introduce a more streamlined bulldozing process in this update. Now, upon toggling off the bulldoze tool, the toolbar will automatically revert back to your previously selected tool, saving you from the tedious task of clicking through toolbars to get back to your original tool.

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/update-88-5/1.mp4" %}

To further ease the bulldozing process, we’ve transitioned the bulldoze hotkey from <kbd>/</kbd> to <kbd>E</kbd>, making it more accessible. Also, when activated, the bulldoze tool will now be highlighted with a red frame, providing clear visual feedback.

Adding a quick-access feature, holding down the <kbd>E</kbd> key will temporarily activate the bulldoze tool. Once you release the key, your previous tool selection will be restored, making it a breeze to switch between tools during gameplay.

## Late-game performance improvements

This update brings noticeable performance improvements, especially in big late-game scenarios. We've also optimized how UI indicators work, particularly when they are hidden, to help make the game run even smoother. The boost in performance can range from just a few extra frames per second to a significant increase of 10-20 FPS. This is part of our ongoing work to improve performance, and we plan to continue making such improvements in future updates to ensure a better gameplay experience.

As always, your feedback is the cornerstone of our development process. Join us in our [Discord community](http://discord.gg/voxeltycoon) to share your experiences, discuss strategies, and connect with fellow gamers. We’re committed to continuous improvement and are excited about the journey ahead with our amazing community 💜

Stay tuned for more updates, and as always, thank you for being part of this exhilarating adventure!

Hey there, Voxel Tycoon community!

We’ve been hard at work here at Voxel Tycoon HQ, analyzing feedback, poring over data, and conducting what might be the most extensive survey in our history. After compiling the results from thousands of responses, a staggering statistic emerged: nearly 99.99% of you delivered a resounding "NO" to level crossings! It turns out bridges and tunnels are the undisputed champions of your transportation empires.

Here are a few examples of your responses to prove we're not lying:

*"In our three-dimensional wonderland, we either go high or dig deep. Level crossings feel like a two-dimensional concept we've transcended."*

*"I've calculated that the time saved by not waiting at level crossings over a year could be used to knit approximately 3.7 sweaters. Bridges and tunnels only, please."*

*"Level crossings disrupt the natural migration paths of the virtual wildlife. It's high time we consider the ecological footprint of our transportation networks."*

*"In my historically accurate recreation of the Roman Empire in Voxel Tycoon, there were no level crossings. Keeping with tradition, I see no need for them."*

In light of this overwhelming consensus, we’re excited to announce a bold new direction for Voxel Tycoon: **we’re saying goodbye to level crossings.** That’s right, from this moment on, our focus shifts entirely to creating the most sophisticated, efficient, and frankly, more aesthetically pleasing alternatives - bridges that stretch majestically into the skies and tunnels that burrow through the very heart of Voxel Earth.

## Why the change?

- **Safety First**: Our virtual citizens can now sleep soundly, knowing they’ll never again be late due to a train crossing.
- **Efficiency**: Why wait when you can go over or under? Our new bridge and tunnel technology ensures your transportation networks are more efficient than ever.
- **Aesthetics**: Let’s be real, bridges and tunnels add that extra bit of flair to your cities. It’s time to embrace the beauty of unobstructed landscapes and architecturally significant overpasses.

## But wait, there’s more!

As part of this groundbreaking update, we’re introducing two premium content packs: the **Ultra-Mega-Super Bridge Kit** and the **Tunnel Tycoon Pack**,  each at the modest price of $10. Get ready to elevate your infrastructure game with these exclusive, one-of-a-kind construction options. Skyline's not the limit!

## And because we love a good surprise…

Gotcha! Fear not, we’re working hard on level crossings and other amazing updates. Happy April Fool’s Day, everyone!

Stay awesome,  
Voxel Tycoon Devs

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/2024-july-development-update/3.png" %}

Hey there, Voxel Tycoon community!

In today's development update, we'll take a detailed look at the recent QoL updates and discuss what's happening with VT development overall.


Many of the improvements and fixes recently implemented were based on direct feedback from players in the `#bug-reports` and `#suggestions` channels on our [Discord](//discord.gg/voxeltycoon). We encourage you to join and share your thoughts with us and the community!

## UI optimization

It's interesting how UI can significantly impact game performance when it starts to hit its limits. While the Voxel Tycoon UI easily handles the content the vanilla game provides, when you start playing with many mods, you can begin to see its weak spots.

The most obvious one appeared to be the Buy window. If you play with many vehicle mods, it could take up to a several minutes (!) to open it the first time, and then cause insane FPS drops while it is open (from 200 to 5 FPS in the case below).

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/2024-july-development-update/4.mp4" alt="This was captured on a developer PC which has enough RAM, GPU, and CPU power to spare." %}

So, we [did some optimizations](/changelog#0.88.9), and here's what we got. You can have as many vehicle mods as you want — the Buy vehicle window now opens immediately regardless and consumes a much smaller portion of frame time while it is open.

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/2024-july-development-update/5.mp4" %}

There were a few other places where playing mod-heavy games caused huge lag spikes and FPS drops: the New game window (specifically the Mods tab) and storage picker popups. Those were optimized as well and now open immediately.

One more place where we applied optimization wasn't affected by mod count, but rather by the size of your empire. It's the Fleet window. Now, you can monitor hundreds of vehicles on your company's balance without significant performance drops.

As a bonus, after all the optimizations, the game can use up to **~500MB** less memory in mod-heavy games.

> If you want to know more details on what caused such drastic performance drops and how we optimized them out, let us know! We'll do a separate post on this (this one is already quite big).

Optimizing performance is an ongoing effort, and there are still many areas where it can be greatly improved. But for now, we want to focus on gameplay features in the next updates.

## Camera Bookmarks

You can [now](/changelog#0.88.7) set specific camera positions as bookmarks using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>0-9</kbd> and quickly return to those spots with <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>0-9</kbd>. This is incredibly useful for managing your empire, allowing you to jump between key locations with ease, while there's no mini-map (which is planned).

We're also going to add dedicated UI for the bookmarks in future updates.

## Orthographic (aka isometric) camera received some 💜

Some of you may not even be aware that this camera mode has been in the game from the very beginning! And now it's finally officially fully supported.

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/2024-july-development-update/2.mp4" %}

It [now](/changelog#0.88.8) locks to 45-degree angles and top-down views, and remains consistent between sessions. There's a new HUD button to toggle this mode, though the <kbd>F9</kbd> hotkey is still available for those who prefer keyboard shortcuts.

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/2024-july-development-update/1.mp4" %}

While making these improvements, we also fixed a few camera-related bugs, like conveyors not being correctly picked in isometric view ([699](https://github.com/voxeltycoon/issues/issues/699)).

## Hotkeys to toggle windows

We added hotkeys to toggle some essential windows: <kbd>F2</kbd> for Fleet, <kbd>F3</kbd> for Research; others are not bound by default and can be set to your preferences.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/2024-july-development-update/1.png" %}

## Other minor changes

### Vehicle replacement changes

After some time playing with vehicle replacement, it became clear that in most cases, players want to replace only existing vehicles and not the ones bought after a replacement order is issued. If a player decides to buy a vehicle they've set up to be replaced, they probably intend to keep it.

So, we made vehicle replacements affect only vehicles that were present at the moment of replacement creation. This also allowed for auto-removal of completed replacements, eliminating the need to manually clean up completed vehicle replacement orders.

### Fixing notification log flaws

We noticed that many players (including ourselves) instinctively move the cursor to the top right corner of the notification log to hide it. However, instead of a close button typically found in this location, there is a notification settings button.

The notification log can be hidden by clicking on its entire header. This was designed so that when you click on the notification counter to bring up the log, you can hide it again without moving the cursor. As a result, a separate hide button wasn't deemed necessary, and when we needed to add a settings button, we placed it in the corner. However, we didn't account for the power of habit.

To address this, we have placed the collapse button where it is expected to be and moved the settings button to the left. You can still hide the log by clicking on its header.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/2024-july-development-update/2.png" %}

Also, one might expect that hitting <kbd>Esc</kbd> while the notification log is expanded will close only it, but instead, a random window (usually the one on top) was closed as well. Now only the notification log will hide on Esc.

## What's next?

As many of you know, we are currently working on the Rails and Roads Rework (aka RRR): a new rail and road laying system that will replace the current one and allow for:

* Level crossings
* Customizable curvature of tracks
* Left-hand traffic
* Diagonal roads
* One-way roads
* Horizontally curved bridges and tunnels
* Planning mode
* Support for blueprints
* Support for path signals
* Better support for modding and interconnection of different types of tracks
* Support for liquids/pipes
* Performance optimizations

It turned out to be much more complex than we initially anticipated. But it's necessary to complete before adding new content to the game, so we've been dedicating a lot of time to it. As a result, other major updates were, if not put on hold, at least slowed down. As you can imagine, this may create the appearance that no more major updates are coming for the game, and, quote, the *game is dead*.

Some of our most devoted community members may remember that the game was initially supposed to be out in Early Access by the end of 2017. But it came out in 2019 as pre-alpha, and only in 2021 did it hit Steam EA.

So, the game isn't *dead*; this is just how we develop it. And it has always been the case; there's nothing new. We prioritize quality over speed of development, and this isn't going to change. Sometimes updates come one after another; sometimes there's complete radio silence because we're just not ready to show anything. We release new updates only when we feel they're up to the bar we've set. And keep in mind that there are just two of us (we tried to hire more people in the past, but it didn't work out for us, both financially and organization-wise).

The good news is, RRR is progressing, and we can see the light at the end of the tunnel. We'll post more on this progress when we're ready. For now, enjoy some of the development artifacts. We occasionally post these in the `#dump` channel on our [Discord server](//discord.gg/voxeltycoon). If you're interested in early sneak peeks, please join us there!

## Updated roadmap

We've moved [our roadmap](/roadmap) to GitHub, aligning it more closely with our development process. Here you can see what we're working on right now and what will be worked on in the future. We will keep it up to date with our current direction.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/2024-july-development-update/4.png" %}

The roadmap has two views: **Board** (like it was before) and **Table** for a better overview. Notice that you can filter and slice data to [your liking](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/changing-the-layout-of-a-view).

## On modding docs

The final issue we need to address is modding documentation. It's clearly lagging behind, and unfortunately, it's challenging to keep it current while the game is in active development. Don't worry, we'll update it eventually. In the meantime, we encourage you to join the `#modding` channel on [Discord](//discord.gg/voxeltycoon) to get assistance and discuss your ideas with our fantastic modding community.

## Thank you!

We really appreciate your patience and support. Thank you for being part of the Voxel Tycoon community, and stay tuned for more exciting updates!

Hello, fellow tycoons! We've got a [little intermediate update](/changelog#0.88.10) for you.

## Vehicles interiors

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/vehicle-interiors/2.mp4" %}

Support for interiors has been a frequently requested feature since the beginning, and now it's finally available. Interiors include driver cabins, passenger seating areas, and other parts of the vehicle's interior space, allowing players to experience vehicles from a first-person perspective.

Interiors are totally optional and purely cosmetic—they won't affect performance during normal gameplay as they are visible only in the Ride Your Vehicle™ mode. But if you love that extra bit of immersion, interiors are a great way to get up close and personal with your favorite vehicles.

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/vehicle-interiors/4.mp4" %}

Modders can define multiple custom player positions (camera spots) inside (or outside) each wagon, giving players more flexibility in choosing their view, whether it's enjoying different visual perspectives or enhancing specific gameplay scenarios like riding as a passenger or observing the animated cockpit in action.

To give you a taste, we've added interiors for a few Tier 1 vehicles, thanks to the awesome work by **scailman** (who also created a [helpful guide](https://docs.voxeltycoon.xyz/guides/content-mods/creating-vehicle-interior/)). You can check them out now and use them as examples for creating your own mods. We'll be gradually adding more interiors to base vehicles over time.

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/vehicle-interiors/5.mp4" %}

To help you enjoy the interiors to the fullest, we've revamped the Ride Your Vehicle™ UI to remove unnecessary windows and toolbars, giving you a cleaner view. We've added new default views—third-person view and side view—beside the already existing hood view and backwards view. Additionally, you can now switch between vehicles by clicking on them directly, without exiting the mode. And last but not least, the camera can now be freely rotated with RMB, without automatically returning to the forward position.

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/vehicle-interiors/6.mp4" %}

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/vehicle-interiors/7.mp4" %}

We’d also like to give a shout-out to the many new mods recently added to the [Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/732050/workshop/). Some creators are already working on adding detailed interiors, showcasing the incredible creativity of our community. We’re excited to see even more amazing mods in the future!

## Tilt and sway

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/vehicle-interiors/3.mp4" %}

Vehicles now tilt and wagons sway when moving, enhancing the sense of realism and adding extra flair to your rides. Enjoy the gentle sway of the wagons with the new side view, or appreciate the movement of the vehicle suspension on tight curves.

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/vehicle-interiors/8.mp4" %}

## Better station queue management

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/vehicle-interiors/1.mp4" %}

We've implemented an internal vehicle update queue to ensure first-in, first-out behavior at heavily loaded stations, helping to reduce delays and improve efficiency during peak times. Previously, a vehicle could get stuck for very long periods if more vehicles kept arriving at the station repeatedly. Thanks to this change, that is no longer the case.

## Bonus 🐞

What’s development without some accidents along the way? Here are a few of them!

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/vehicle-interiors/9.mp4" %}
{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/vehicle-interiors/10.mp4" %}

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/vehicle-interiors/15.mp4" %}
{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/vehicle-interiors/1.jpg" %}

Keep in mind that we occasionally share them in the `#dump` channel on our [Discord server](//discord.gg/voxeltycoon). If you’re interested in early sneak peeks, be sure to join us there!

## Thank you!

Here's the [full changelog](/changelog#0.88.10) for the especially curious. Stay tuned for more updates—we're always working to improve your experience! Thank you to our amazing community for your continued support and feedback. We couldn't do it without you!

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/wear-and-tear-update/thumb.png" %}

This update brings a brand new layer of challenge to how you manage your transport empire. With the introduction of the wear and reliability system, keeping your fleet in good shape becomes more important than ever. You'll now have to think not just about routes and schedules, but also long-term maintenance and strategic replacements — all while staying ahead of potential traffic jams and extra costs. If you want to dive into the full list of changes, you can find the complete changelog [here](/changelog#0.89), as usual.

## Under the Hood: Wear and Maintenance

Let's start with the most obvious addition: the new vehicle wear and reliability system. Each vehicle now has a reliability stat that determines how quickly it wears down with use. Early-game vehicles tend to be less reliable, while modern ones become increasingly dependable.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/wear-and-tear-update/8.png" %}

If a vehicle isn’t serviced regularly, its performance will begin to drop. This makes proper maintenance not just a good idea, but a critical part of your transport strategy. Unserviced vehicles also wear out faster, amplifying the issue.

Once a vehicle becomes fully worn out, it'll demand more frequent services just to stay operational, leading to increasing maintenance costs and longer periods of reduced performance. If left unchecked, this can trigger traffic jams and cascading delays.

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/wear-and-tear-update/3.mp4" %}

Each vehicle now displays detailed wear information in the UI, making it easier to stay on top of these issues. Since a train can consist of multiple locomotives, each one wears down independently — meaning different locomotives in the same train may have varying levels of wear. Wear is also shown in the Fleet Window (based on the most worn-out part of a consist), allowing you to quickly assess each vehicle’s condition at a glance.

To keep everything running smoothly, you'll need to schedule regular maintenance by sending vehicles to depots at appropriate intervals. Service intervals are configurable per vehicle, so you're in full control over how often your fleet visits the depot.

That said, there might be situations where choosing a longer — or even no — maintenance interval could make sense. It all depends on your immediate goals and broader strategy. Whether you're squeezing every last mile out of a vehicle before replacement or minimizing downtime in a critical supply chain, there's room for experimentation.

And speaking of depots, you can now add them directly to a vehicle’s schedule — just like regular stations. This gives you full control over when and where maintenance happens, making it a seamless part of your transport flow.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/wear-and-tear-update/9.png" %}

On the visual side, wear comes with a cosmetic touch: smoke emitted from the vehicle darkens as wear builds up, giving a clear visual cue that something's not quite right. In addition, worn-out locomotives and trucks become visibly tilted, further emphasizing their deteriorating condition.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/wear-and-tear-update/6.png" %}

We've also introduced vehicle replacement based on wear levels. You can now set a threshold for when a vehicle should be replaced due to wear. When this setting is enabled, you can also enable self-replacement, effectively allowing vehicles to automatically replace themselves when worn out.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/wear-and-tear-update/5.png" %}

## A New Generation of Trucks

Fleet variety has gotten a major boost. We've added brand-new trucks for each generation and reworked older ones to better match today's standards. Shoutout to @scailman for the amazing help with this overhaul!  

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/wear-and-tear-update/1.mp4" %}

Each vehicle has also been rebalanced to offer unique strengths and weaknesses. This means your transport strategy will matter more than ever — whether you're prioritizing reliability, speed, or capacity.

## Smarter, Smoother, and More Intuitive

Vehicles and buildings are now clearly categorized as "current" or "obsolete" as you progress through research, making it easier to keep track of what's relevant for your tech level.

Higher-tier vehicles are no longer locked behind Tier II depots — instead, those depots now come with the perk of lower maintenance costs. This change also resolves a long-standing source of confusion: many players would research Depot II expecting access to new vehicles, only to discover that those vehicles were gated behind separate research. That disconnect caused unnecessary frustration, and we're glad to be putting it behind us.

We've also cleaned up the vehicle scheduling experience by removing confusing options that didn't make sense for waypoints.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/wear-and-tear-update/2.png" %}

Another ongoing effort we'd like to highlight is performance optimization. It's something we never stop working on — even if the results aren't always flashy or immediately visible. With this update, we continued the optimization work that began in [earlier updates](/devlog/2024-july-development-update/#ui-optimization) and specifically targeted the Builder Tool window. If you play with lots of mods installed, you should get better performance here: fewer lags, less FPS drops, and reduced memory consumption.

We’ve also made a couple of quality-of-life improvements. When placing signals, the regular signal is now selected by default instead of the pre-signal, making construction more intuitive. Additionally, the Settings window now includes a search function — just start typing to quickly filter and find the option you need.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/wear-and-tear-update/4.png" %}

## Squashed Bugs and Polished Gears

We've tackled several stubborn bugs. First up, a rare issue where the UI could become completely unresponsive has been fixed. We also resolved a visual bug affecting heap item storage rendering.

One of the more infamous bugs — the so-called "Worm Train" issue — caused a pink tint to remain after using the vehicle picker tool. That's gone now.

{% include img.html src="/assets/posts/wear-and-tear-update/7.png" alt="The Worm Train case." %}

Trains should also behave better when leaving depots. We fixed a case where they couldn't find their path, and another rare but amusing bug where trains could explode when turning around while still partially inside a depot.

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/wear-and-tear-update/2.mp4" %}

## For the Modding Wizards

There's something here for modders to enjoy. Most notably, you can now repaint assets directly in the game world using the new **Paint Assets** tool. To enable it, open Settings while holding <kbd>Shift</kbd>, go to the **Misc** tab, and toggle **Asset Paint Tool** (you can type `Asset` to find it). Then reload your save file — the tool will appear in the Toolbar under the **Other** category. After painting, click on the changed mesh in the list above the color picker to save changes to disk or revert them. 

Note that enabling this setting introduces a performance overhead that will persist until you reload the world, even if the tool is no longer in use — so be sure to disable it once you're done, and reload your save file.

{% include video.html src="/assets/posts/wear-and-tear-update/4.mp4" alt="Pro Tip: Hold <kbd>Alt</kbd> to pick colors from any other asset in the world." %}

We've also added a new `Generation` property for buildings, cars, and trains, as well as a `Reliability` property for cars and trains. There's now a new `Experimental` vehicle engine type too. Storage definitions have been simplified with a new `Bounds` property that automatically handles Resolution and Keyframes. Auto price calculation now takes both max speed and reliability into account, making for more accurate pricing behavior.

## Thank you 💜

That's it for now! We want to take a moment to say thank you. Thanks a lot for all the thoughtful feedback — it really means a lot that people are still thinking about the game, whether you're actively playing or just keeping an eye on things.

The game is being developed — slowly, but surely. As some of you rightly guessed, it's a passion project, and we're a very small team doing our best to build something meaningful and long-lasting. We always aimed for a steady, honest approach instead of rushing features.

We totally understand if some of you expected things to be further along by now. Truth is, we wish we could move faster too, but we also don't want to compromise the quality and vision we had from the start.

The Rails and Roads Rework is indeed our next major milestone, and we all agree — it's a big one. It's a foundational update that touches core gameplay and will open the door to many long-awaited features and improvements. We're genuinely excited about it, and we think many of you will be too once it lands.

For those of you who joined us recently: what is the Rails and Roads Rework (RRR), exactly? In short, it's a comprehensive overhaul of how railways and road networks are built, managed, and interact with each other. One of the most exciting additions will be proper level crossings — something many of you have asked for. It's a huge technical task, but we're building it to support a more flexible, immersive transport system in the long term.

Again, thanks for your patience and continued interest. Whether you have 900+ hours or you're just discovering the game, we really appreciate you being here.

If you'd like to stay in the loop, ask questions, or just hang out with fellow players, feel free to join us over on [Discord](//discord.gg/VoxelTycoon) — we'd love to have you.

Happy transporting!
